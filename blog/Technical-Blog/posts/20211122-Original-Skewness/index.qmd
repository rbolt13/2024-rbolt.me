This post will give a physical interpretation of skewness that will help you always know if a graph is left or right skewed. 


# `Physical Interpretation`

Imagine your body is a symmetrical bell curve where your neck is your mode, waist is your median, hips are your mean, and are all stacked on top of each other to create a symmetrical bell. 

When the hips are to the the right of your neck then you are creating a right skew. When you hips are to the left of your neck then your body bell curve is left skewed as shown in the diagram below.
