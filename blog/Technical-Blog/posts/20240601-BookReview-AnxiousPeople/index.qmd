# Introduction

"Anxious People" by Fredrik Backman is a contemporary fiction novel that explores the lives of a diverse group of strangers connected by a botched bank heist and a hostage situation. The story delves into the characters anxieties, relationships, and the unexpected ways their lives intersect. In this review, I will discuss the book's structure, themes such as class divide and second chances, and some memorable quotes that stood out to me.

# Themes

## Structure 

I found the structure of the book tedious due to its numerous short chapters that jump between characters and time periods. While this doesn't make the story difficult to follow, it does make it hard to care about the characters. Most of the characters are written to be annoying, and although the intent is to eventually make the reader empathize with them, this payoff didn’t work for me. We learn why people are the way they are, but it doesn't feel earned.

The constant shifts in perspective and time can disrupt the narrative flow, making it challenging to become fully invested in any single storyline. This fragmented approach might have been intended to mirror the characters' anxieties and chaotic lives, but for me, it resulted in a lack of emotional connection and depth. The interviews, meant to provide insight into the characters' backgrounds and motivations, often felt repetitive and dragged on, further diminishing my engagement with the story.

## Class Divide 

A significant portion of this novel takes place during an apartment viewing, featuring a variety of characters from different financial backgrounds. For instance, there's a bank robber struggling to make ends meet and a banker who attends apartment viewings merely to judge the apartments and the people viewing them. This setup effectively highlights the contrasts between the lives of those with financial stability and those facing financial struggles.

The novel underscores the idea that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer, emphasizing that the real class divide is between those who can borrow money and those who can't. This economic disparity profoundly affects the characters' opportunities, relationships, and mental health.

Additionally, the novel critiques the notion that homes should be viewed as investments rather than places to live. It delves into the emotional and psychological toll of treating housing as a commodity, where the value of a home is measured in financial terms rather than as a sanctuary or a space for personal growth. This perspective shifts focus from creating a nurturing living environment to maximizing profit, often leading to a sense of instability and insecurity for those who are unable to keep up with the market's demands. The story suggests that when homes are seen merely as financial assets, it exacerbates economic divides and diminishes the quality of life for many, ultimately questioning the ethics and sustainability of such an approach to housing.

## Second Chances 

Despite facing significant personal failures, tragedies, and societal stigmas, these characters find redemption through the compassion and solidarity they offer each other. The story emphasizes how their lives, once intertwined, create a network of empathy and understanding that fosters personal growth and healing. Through their shared experiences, the characters learn that even the most challenging circumstances can lead to new beginnings and the chance for a better future.

# Quotes

> Anyone can nurture a myth about their life if they have enough manure, so if the grass looks greener on the other side of the fence, that’s probably because it’s full of shit.

> Addicts are good at lying, but never as good as their children. 

> Unfortunately I think most people would still get more sympathy from their colleagues and bosses at work if they show up looking rough one morning and say 'I'm hungover' than if they say 'I'm suffering from anxiety.'

> One of the most human things about anxiety is that we try to cure chaos with chaos. Someone who has got themselves into a catastrophic situation rarely retreats from it, we're far more inclined to carry on even faster.

> He said you don't have to lead by telling other people what to do, you can lead by just letting them do what they're capable of instead. So I tried to be a teacher more than a boss.

> God doesn't protect people from knives, sweetheart. That's why God gave us other people, so we can protect each other. We need to be allowed to convince ourselves that we're more than the mistakes we made yesterday. That we are all of our next choices, too, all of our tomorrows.

> Humor is the soul's last line of defense, and as long as we're laughing we alive, so bad puns and fart jokes were their way of expressing their defiance against despair.

> Love is wanting you to exist.

> So the only thing a mom who was a priest demanded of her family was simple: that we do our best. We plant an apple tree today, even if we know the world is going to be destroyed tomorrow. We save those we can.

> You saved yourself. He just happened to be there.

> We're looking for something to cling on to, something to fight for, something to look forward to. We're doing all we can to teach our children how to swim. We all have this in common, yet most of us remain strangers, we never know what we do to each other, how your life is affected by mine.

# Conclusion 

"Anxious People" presents a tapestry of human experiences, woven together by themes of anxiety, class divide, second chances, and complex relationships. Despite me not enjoying the book, it provides valuable insights into the human condition and the power of empathy.
