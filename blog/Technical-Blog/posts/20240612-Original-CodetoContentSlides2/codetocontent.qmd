In the upper right is the most current iteration that has an image of me and my niece. The middle right image is the iteration of my blog from 2023 with a picture of me in Takamatsu, Japan. The second image from the bottom on the right is from my blog from 2022, and has an emoji of me giving a thumbs up and some blog posts. The bottom right image is of an .Rmd site I created to take notes for a class. The image on the upper left is the first .Rmd site I created in 2020 with an image of the letter 'R' on fire. The bottom left image is of the second .Rmd site I created with a table of contents showing what each tab is. The middle bottom image is the first iteration of my blog from 2021."}

The upper right image is a TidyTuesday graph showing NCAA data for 2024. The middle right image is the first TidyTuesday graph I did in 2023 with Bob Ross data. The bottom right image is a post about creating test data for a government tracking system. The far bottom left image is an early post from 2021 that shows a drawing for 'Let Epsilon = min(x-a, b-a)'. The image second from the left on the bottom is a post giving advice to anyone learning LaTeX. The image second from the right on the bottom is a post with notes from a PDX R User Group event about making tables with the GT package."}
