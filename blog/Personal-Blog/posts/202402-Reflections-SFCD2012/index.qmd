When I was 19 I had the privileged of training at the San Francisco Conservatory of Dance. It was a pivotal point in my life, that still defines the person I am today. While I was there I kept a journal to keep track of all the things I've learned and i still read through it over a decade later.

# Day 1

## Summer's Classes 

> It's not selfish to want to know everything about yourself. 

Dance is so internally focused, that at times you can geel guilty about spending so much time focusing on yourself. The thing is you are not just focusing, you are studying and learning about yourself. When you are able to reflect you own mistakes and make physical change to improve which is noticed and impacts your life. Its powerful. 

This was one of the first things Summer told us when we first showed up. I remember very clearly sitting on the floor around her sitting in her chair. 

> Instead of trying to get rid of negative self talk; make no space for it. 

There was this beautiful woman we danced with there named Auroa, and she looked like the disney princess Auroa. Not to mention she was an amazing dancer. Always front and center, and if she didn't put herself there she was asked to be there. Beleive me Auroa was a sweetheart. I remember we would do these  pirouette combinations. 

> Instead of holding your standing side think of it as flung open and you are pulling it back closed. 


> Think about the next place the body wants to go, which is usually extended out like crazy. 


> Don't think of holding muscles in any position. Feel as though you are resisting against space. 


> Don't just do moves. 

> When in plie feel the heavy weight of your bottom half. Feel like you are sandbags or a big heavy crazy hat. 

> Be aware of waist

> Take your torso (waist) with you, cause not doing so is stupid. 

## Alex

> Take yourself out of the cookie cutter idea of what looks good. Be more instinctual. Not focused on what looks right, but trying to look at the movement in as many differnt ways as possible. 

This guy was kind of a creep. 

## Aline

> Use momentum. 

> Try to dance in sync with the dancers around you. 

Be more aware of the people in your space, and how you fit with that. 

> Stretch with muscular intention. 

Like rubber bands. 

> After you stretch be mindful of how it has affected your body. 

# Day 2

> Drive movement with the top in seams of thighs. 

> Make your 5th position funcitonal like a facet. You can buy a facet and set it on the counter, but that not functional. Make your 5th position functional. 


> Don't train to fix the problem. Be so prepared that only very rarely you need to fix problems. 

Don't build fixes for your shortcomings, fix your short comings. 

> Seriously be aware of waist. It holds you so your legs can do their job. 

Frappés

> Don't hold pose's. Image the sensation of running through a field. 

> Really explore the depths of plié in movement. 

> Really find the time in between movement 

## Alex

Alex you to have this game(?), I think called he "Hot Mess", which we would have to do silly things. I think at the time my understanding was a lot of these girls were ballerinas, and he was trying to get more natrual movement from them. Still, reading a lot of this stuff now it kind of just seems creepy. 

One of things we had to do this day was tickle ourselves and repeat the phrase "I'm so itchy and smelly". 

## Christain 

We did a lot of improve in Christains classes, like consecutive hours. Today we did bunch of differnt things. One example was we got into small groups of four, and 1 person closed their eyes and moved forward. The other three were obstacles in their way they had to move around. 

## My Own Reflections that Day

> It's not about good or bad, right or wrong, but importance. 

> I don't move like other people and they don't move like me, but I can still search and find their importance. 


## Days 3 and 4

> When we hold tension somewhere its becasue we are compensating for something else. 

> There is not
