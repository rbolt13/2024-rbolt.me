    "text": "Rating: 9/10  Overview: Examines cars’ impact on society, illustrating the negative effects of car culture and challenging its dominance.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn his compelling and thought-provoking book, Carmageddon: How Cars Make Life Worse and What to Do About It, Daniel Knowles invites readers to reconsider the pervasive dominance of automobiles in modern society. Through sharp analysis and persuasive arguments, Knowles explores the multifaceted ways in which car culture adversely affects our daily lives. Below, I share some of the insights and reflections that resonated with me long after turning the last page.\n\n\nCivil Rights and Public Transportation\n\nThe automotive industry’s exponential growth coincided with the era when people of color finally gained the right to sit anywhere on public transportation. This pivotal moment in civil rights history marks a complex intersection with the rise of car culture.\nIn the United States, the expansion of roads and highways was strategically planned in ways that often had deleterious effects on certain communities. These construction projects were intentionally routed to displace specific groups or sever their access to vital city resources, exacerbating social and economic divides.\nDisplacement due to these infrastructure projects frequently forced communities into areas lacking in essential public transportation services. This not only marginalized these groups further but also entrenched car dependency as a primary mode of mobility, despite its broader societal impacts.\nThe Albina Vision Trust in Portland is an exemplary organization actively working to address and rectify transportation policies, among other institutional decisions, that have historically led to the displacement of hundreds of families. Their efforts highlight a crucial movement towards reconciling past injustices with forward-thinking urban and transportation planning.\n\n\n\nCars and Classism\n\nCars since their origination have been a sign of the upper class. Even today you are seen as “less” if you do not own a car.\nA lot of jobs require people to have a drivers license or “valid form of transportation”, which means driving. Even though there are plenty of valid forms of transportation that are not driving.\nOn Class, Capitalism and Urban Planning in Who Framed Roger Rabbit , delves into an intriguing analysis of the film, which is based on the true story of the dismantling of trolley systems across the United States. It offers a compelling look at how the movie intertwines the narratives of class, capitalism, and urban planning, highlighting the profound impact of the automobile industry’s rise on public transit and, by extension, society at large.\nIn Kenneth Grahame’s classic novel, The Wind in the Willows, the character of Mr. Toad epitomizes the reckless and inconsiderate motorist, reflecting critiques of upper-class driving behaviors. For an intriguing dive into the real-world inspiration behind this memorable character, explore the article: Meet the Real-Life Inspiration Behind “Mr.Toad”.\n\n\n\nParking\n\nSociety’s preference for free parking over affordable housing is starkly evident in the increasing number of individuals living out of RVs and cars. This phenomenon highlights a troubling reality: in many areas, it’s more financially feasible to secure a parking spot for a vehicle than to afford living accommodations.\nUrban planning regulations often mandate a disproportionate allocation of parking spaces relative to the square footage of buildings, irrespective of the practical need for such extensive parking. This is particularly illogical for certain types of establishments, such as bars, where the excessive requirement for parking does not align with the nature of the business.\nThe prioritization of free parking spaces over the availability of public bathrooms underscores a misalignment in urban development priorities, where the convenience of car owners is often placed above basic public amenities.\nIdealized representations of car-centric cities frequently omit the extensive infrastructure devoted to parking. These depictions fail to acknowledge the visual, spatial, and environmental impact of parking lots and garages, presenting an unrealistically clean and uncluttered urban landscape.\nThe mandated quantity of parking in urban areas contributes to sprawling city layouts, with destinations spaced too far apart for practical walking. This sprawling effect contradicts one of the fundamental advantages of city living: the ability to navigate the urban environment on foot. By encouraging car dependency, current parking requirements undermine the walkability and, ultimately, the very essence of city life.\n\n\n\nTraffic\n\nTraffic congestion is inherently linked to the prevalence of cars. The solution to reducing traffic lies not in expanding road networks but in decreasing car usage.\nA shift towards public transportation, coupled with investments in its infrastructure, could significantly alleviate traffic congestion. Prioritizing transit development over the construction of more roads offers a sustainable path to reducing urban traffic.\nThe average driver spends a considerable amount of time stuck in traffic, a reality conspicuously absent from car advertisements. These commercials often portray an idealized driving experience, sidestepping the common frustration of traffic jams that many drivers face daily.\n\n\n\nThe Lethal Impact of Some Vehicles\n\nCars are usually designed to keep you safe in crashes. They have special features like engines that drop down and fronts that crumple to absorb crash impacts, protecting the people inside. But, there’s a big problem with large, lifted trucks and vans. Their height means they often skip right over those safety features in smaller cars. Instead of the front crumpling and absorbing the crash, these big vehicles can crash directly into where passengers sit, causing much worse injuries, and fatalities.\nCar manufacturers are aware that these big trucks and vans are more dangerous in accidents. Still, they keep selling them because they’re profitable, not just the vehicles themselves but also all the extra accessories they can sell.\nChoosing one of these big vehicles might feel safer because they’re so sturdy and high off the ground. But the truth is, they turn accidents into much more dangerous situations.\n\n\n\nCharity Car Clubs: A Strategic Image Shift\n\nAware of their controversial impact, car manufacturers have sought to align themselves with the emblematic “American Dream.” To cultivate a positive public image, they’ve initiated charity car clubs. These initiatives gather car owners to engage in charitable activities, all under the auspices of the car company’s brand.\nThis strategy is designed to forge a strong association between car ownership and membership in a commendable community. It intentionally crafts the narrative that owning a car from a particular brand elevates one’s social standing, embedding the vehicle not just as a means of transport but as a symbol of belonging to a virtuous circle.\n\n\n\nVehicles in Developing Nations\n\nThe United States, along with other developed nations, enforces rigorous environmental and safety standards for vehicles. Consequently, cars that no longer comply with these stringent regulations in their home countries are often exported to developing nations.\nThe implementation of import regulations on vehicles by developing countries can inadvertently widen the socioeconomic divide. Such policies may restrict access to affordable transportation for lower-income segments, exacerbating the gap between different social classes.\n\n\n\nCar Corporations and Public Health\n\nThe Volkswagen emissions scandal revealed the company cheated on emissions tests, significantly impacting environmental and public health standards.\nStudies indicate lead from gasoline significantly impaired the IQ of nearly half the U.S. population. The elimination of leaded gasoline has been a critical step in removing a major public health threat, marking a pivotal victory against environmental pollution caused by automotive fuels.\n\n\n\nLimitations of Electric Cars\n\nIn cities where the electrical grid relies on coal for power, the environmental benefits of electric cars are negated. The reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation means that even zero-emission vehicles indirectly contribute to pollution.\nThe production of electric car batteries involves extensive mining operations due to their large size compared to smartphone batteries. This increased demand for raw materials significantly exacerbates the environmental impact associated with their extraction and processing.\nInvestments in infrastructure projects like the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop a one-way, one-lane tunnel that permits only a single car at a time, represents a questionable allocation of resources. This system pales in comparison to traditional subway systems, which offer higher capacity, efficiency, and speed at lower costs.\n\n\n\nGender Bias in Transporation\n\nPublic transportation systems often overlook the needs of women, despite their higher usage rates compared to men.\nMothers, in particular, face challenges when navigating buses or trains with children, highlighting a lack of family-friendly amenities.\nThe design and routing of many public transit options cater predominantly to the conventional nine-to-five work commute, neglecting the complex daily routines of individuals like stay-at-home moms who juggle school drop-offs, grocery shopping, and other errands.\nHistorically, crash test dummies were based on male body types, leading to vehicle safety features that are more optimized for men than for women.\nChild safety in vehicles largely falls to parents, as standard car seat designs cater to adults, not children, necessitating additional child-specific safety equipment.\n\n\n\nWalkable Cities\n\nWalkable cities emphasize pedestrian access, fostering healthier lifestyles by minimizing dependence on cars.\nShifting towards these urban designs offers notable environmental advantages, such as diminished air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\nNotable examples include quaint college towns and places like Disney World’s Epcot, designed for easy pedestrian navigation across areas. Unlike the sprawling urban developments of today, these examples showcase the practicality and appeal of compact, walkable communities, underscoring the need for a return to more human-scale urban planning.\n\n\n\nConlusion\nIn “Carmageddon: How Cars Make Life Worse and What to Do About It,” Daniel Knowles navigates the intricate ways in which automobile dominance shapes modern society, spotlighting its profound impact on everything from civil rights and classism to urban planning and public health."

    "text": "This week the Ready4R mailing list focus on crosstables, also known as two-way tables.\n\n\n\nA crosstable of manufacturers cereals with mascots.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nReady4R is a mailing list offering a free online course initiated by local Oregonian Ted Laderas to impart foundational knowledge in rstats and the tidyverse. Subscribers receive a weekly email delving into various methods for data exploration and analysis. On a weekly basis, I will look into these examples, providing additional insights based on my own experiences.\n\n\nCrosstables\nCrosstables are a helpful way to compare the results of two or more variables in a table, so that we can start asking questions about how they relate. We start this week using the same cereals dataset, but slightly modifying it.\n\n\nShow code\n# Install Package\n# Load Packages\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(janitor)\n# Load Data\ncereals &lt;- readr::read_csv(\"../../../../data/cereal.csv\") |&gt;\n  # clean names by converting to lowercase, replace spaces \n  # with underscore and removes special characters\n  janitor::clean_names() |&gt;\n  # make shelf an ordered factor\n  dplyr::mutate(shelf = factor(shelf, ordered = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  # convert mfr and type columns to categorical data\n  dplyr::mutate(across(c(\"mfr\", \"type\"), as.factor))\n# Rename Labels\nmanu_labels &lt;- c(\"American Home\"=\"A\",\n                   \"General Mills\"=\"G\",\n                   \"Kelloggs\"=\"K\",\n                   \"Nabisco\" = \"N\",\n                   \"Post\" = \"P\",\n                   \"Quaker Oats\" = \"Q\", \n                   \"Ralston Purina\" = \"R\")\ncereals &lt;- cereals |&gt;\n  dplyr::mutate(mfr = forcats::fct_recode(mfr, !!!manu_labels))\n\n\n\n\nCrosstabs with janitor::tabyl()\nFor a single variable we can use janitor::tabyl() to view counts and percentages, as shown below:\n\n\nShow code\ncereals |&gt;\n  janitor::tabyl(shelf) \n\n\n shelf  n   percent\n     1 20 0.2597403\n     2 21 0.2727273\n     3 36 0.4675325\n\n\nA slick way to get counts and percentage per shelf (AKA our ordered factor variable). Next we may want to know whether the manufacturers (factor variable) are evenly distributed in terms of cereal type (factor variable). Note: Use adorn_percentages() and adorn_n() interchangeably to get percentages or counts.\n\n\nShow code\ncereals |&gt;\n  # Create frequency table of manufacturers by type\n  janitor::tabyl(mfr, type) |&gt;\n  # Calculate percentages based on hot and cold cereal totals\n  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = \"row\") |&gt;\n  # Format percentages\n  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting() |&gt;\n  # Add totals\n  janitor::adorn_ns() |&gt;\n  # Nicely format table\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nmfr\nC\nH\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Home\n0.0% (0)\n100.0% (1)\n\n\nGeneral Mills\n100.0% (22)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nKelloggs\n100.0% (23)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nNabisco\n83.3% (5)\n16.7% (1)\n\n\nPost\n100.0% (9)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nQuaker Oats\n87.5% (7)\n12.5% (1)\n\n\nRalston Purina\n100.0% (8)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\underline{\\textbf{Insights}}\\)\n\nOnly 1 manufacturer makes hots cereals: American Home\nOnly 2 manufacturers make both hot and cold cereal: Nabisco and Quaker Oats\nThe remaining 4 manufacturers only make cold cereals: General Mills, Kelloggs, Post, and Raiston Purina\n\n\n\nShelf Height and Marketing\nNow let’s look at the distribution of cereals across different shelf heights (1 = bottom, 2 = middle, and 3 = top). According to an article cited by Ted titled Cereal aisle psychology: All eyes on the consumer, researchers conducted a two-part study confirming that cereals targeting children are typically placed about 23 inches off the ground. They observed that cereals on the top shelves often feature characters staring straight ahead or slightly upward to make eye contact with adults, while those on lower shelves, adorned with cartoon characters with large inviting eyes, create eye contact with children.\nLets use crosstables to visualize how manufacturers distribute their cereals across shelves.\n\n\nShow code\ncereals |&gt;\n  # Create frequency table of manufacturers by shelf\n  janitor::tabyl(mfr, shelf) |&gt;\n  # Calculate percentages based on shelf total\n  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator=\"row\") |&gt;\n  # Format percentages\n  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting() |&gt;\n  # Add totals\n  janitor::adorn_ns() |&gt;\n  # Nicely format table\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nmfr\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Home\n0.0% (0)\n100.0% (1)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nGeneral Mills\n27.3% (6)\n31.8% (7)\n40.9% (9)\n\n\nKelloggs\n17.4% (4)\n30.4% (7)\n52.2% (12)\n\n\nNabisco\n50.0% (3)\n33.3% (2)\n16.7% (1)\n\n\nPost\n22.2% (2)\n11.1% (1)\n66.7% (6)\n\n\nQuaker Oats\n12.5% (1)\n37.5% (3)\n50.0% (4)\n\n\nRalston Purina\n50.0% (4)\n0.0% (0)\n50.0% (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\underline{\\textbf{Insights}}\\)\n\nAmerican Home exclusively markets its cereals on the second shelf.\nNabisco primarily markets its cereals on the bottom shelf, presumably targeting children.\nGeneral Mills, Kelloggs, Post, and Quaker Oats mainly target adults, as they primarily market their cereals on the top shelf..\nRalston Purina evenly splits its marketing efforts between the top and bottom shelves.\n\n\n\nWhich shelves have cereal mascots?\nNext, let’s investigate which shelves feature cereal mascots, assuming that mascots often indicate cereals marketed towards children. Using data scraped by Ted from the article “268 Cereal Mascots,” we can identify cereals with mascots and their distribution across shelves.\nBelow we clean and join our data sets, and then check the dimmensions are correct.\n\n\nShow code\n# Load Data\nm_c &lt;- utils::read.csv(\"../../../../data/mascots.csv\",\n                       row.names = NULL)\n# Clean cereal names\nm_c &lt;- m_c |&gt;\nmutate(name=stringr::str_replace(name,\"Cap’n Crunch cereals\", \"Cap'n'Crunch\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(name=stringr::str_replace(name, \"Count Chocula cereal\", \"Count Chocula\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(name=stringr::str_replace(name, \"Honey Smacks\", \"Smacks\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(name=stringr::str_replace(name, \"Mini-Wheats\", \"Frosted Mini-Wheats\")) \n# join with cereals data\nmascot_count &lt;- cereals |&gt;\n  left_join(y=m_c, by=\"name\") |&gt;\n  mutate(has_mascot = ifelse(is.na(mascot), \"No\", \"Yes\")) \n# check dimension\ndim(mascot_count)\n\n\n[1] 80 19\n\n\nLet’s do a Quick Check!, and look at the second shelf to see any obvious errors in the data.\n\n\nShow code\nmascot_count |&gt;\n  # Filter to second shelf\n  dplyr::filter(shelf==2) |&gt;\n  # Select only name, manufacturer, mascot, and has_mascot\n  select(name, mfr, mascot, has_mascot) |&gt;\n  # Arrange by mascot \n  arrange(mascot) |&gt;\n  # Nicely format table\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nmfr\nmascot\nhas_mascot\n\n\n\n\nCocoa Puffs\nGeneral Mills\nBuzz the Bee\nYes\n\n\nCap’n’Crunch\nQuaker Oats\nCap’n Crunch (Horatio Magellan Crunch)\nYes\n\n\nCocoa Puffs\nGeneral Mills\nCocoa Puffs’ Sheik of Shake\nYes\n\n\nCorn Pops\nKelloggs\nCornelius (Corny) the Corn\nYes\n\n\nCount Chocula\nGeneral Mills\nCount Chocula\nYes\n\n\nSmacks\nKelloggs\nDig’em Frog\nYes\n\n\nFruity Pebbles\nPost\nFred Flintstone\nYes\n\n\nLucky Charms\nGeneral Mills\nLucky the Leprechaun\nYes\n\n\nFrosted Mini-Wheats\nKelloggs\nMr. Mini-Wheats\nYes\n\n\nCocoa Puffs\nGeneral Mills\nSonny the Cuckoo Bird\nYes\n\n\nRaisin Bran\nKelloggs\nThe Raisin Bran Sun\nYes\n\n\nFroot Loops\nKelloggs\nToucan Sam\nYes\n\n\nTrix\nGeneral Mills\nTrix Rabbit\nYes\n\n\nCinnamon Toast Crunch\nGeneral Mills\nWendell\nYes\n\n\nApple Jacks\nKelloggs\nNA\nNo\n\n\nCream of Wheat (Quick)\nNabisco\nNA\nNo\n\n\nGolden Grahams\nGeneral Mills\nNA\nNo\n\n\nHoney Graham Ohs\nQuaker Oats\nNA\nNo\n\n\nKix\nGeneral Mills\nNA\nNo\n\n\nLife\nQuaker Oats\nNA\nNo\n\n\nMaypo\nAmerican Home\nNA\nNo\n\n\nNut&Honey Crunch\nKelloggs\nNA\nNo\n\n\nStrawberry Fruit Wheats\nNabisco\nNA\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\nTed notes that there are duplicate rows for cereals, because mascots can change over time, or have multiple mascots.

Through these analyses, we gain valuable insights into how cereal manufacturers strategically position their products, offering a glimpse into the fascinating world of consumer psychology and marketing dynamics.\n\n\nW.E.B. Dubois’ Visualizations (Black History Month)\nBorn in 1868, Du Bois was not only a scholar and activist but also an innovative thinker in the realm of data representation. As the first Black American to earn a doctorate from Harvard, he embarked on a journey through Europe before returning to the United States to focus on social sciences.\nDriven by a fervent desire to elevate the rights and livelihoods of Black people, Du Bois recognized the power of compelling evidence in effecting societal change. However, he understood that mere statistical data alone could not dismantle generations of racial oppression.\nOne of his seminal works emerged during the 1900 Paris Exposition, where Du Bois seized the opportunity to narrate the story of Black Americans through a novel medium: charts. His collection of 63 data visualizations titled “The Exhibit of American Negroes” was divided into two sections. The first, “A Series of Statistical Charts Illustrating the Condition of the Descendants of Former African Slaves Now in Residence in the United States of America,” offered a broad view of the data at national and international levels. The companion piece, “The Georgia Negro,” focused on a singular state, providing a localized perspective.\nDu Bois meticulously organized his charts into three distinct viewpoints—international, national, and local—thereby weaving a comprehensive narrative encompassing African American history, education, business development, and property ownership. Through interconnected data points, he crafted an elaborate story that evolved seamlessly from the local to the international arena, reinforcing the narrative of Black empowerment and resilience.\n\\(\\underline{\\textbf{Articles}}\\)\n\nHow W.E.B.

    "section": "",
    "text": "In this blog post, we will explore basic Python commands for managing virtual environments and installing packages. These commands will help you set up isolated environments for your Python projects, ensuring clean and organized development.\n\n\nIntroduction\nThe information provided here is based on the YouTube video titled “Python Tutorial: VENV (Mac & Linux) - How to Use Virtual Environments with the Built-In venv Module” by Corey Schafer.\nNote: Remember not to commit the virtual environment (venv) and include it in the .gitignore file. However, do commit the requirements.txt file for package version control.\nLet’s dive into the essential Python commands:\n\n\n1. Checking Installed Packages in the Global Environment\nTo view the list of packages installed on your machine in the global environment, execute the following command in your terminal:\n\npip3 list\n\n\n\n2. Creating a Virtual Environment\nTo create a virtual environment, use the following command:\n\npython3 -m venv project_name\n\n\n\n3. Creating a Virtual Environment in a Project Folder\nIt’s important to avoid placing your project files within the virtual environment. Instead, create the virtual environment in a project folder by executing the following command:\n\npython3 -m venv project_folder/project_name\n\n\n\n4. Activating the Virtual Environment\nTo activate the virtual environment, run the appropriate command based on your operating system:\n\nactivate virtual enviroment\n\n\n\n5. Checking the Python Version in the Virtual Environment\nTo determine the Python version being used within the virtual environment, use the following command:\n\nwhich python\n\n\n\n6. Checking Installed Packages in the Virtual Environment\nTo view the packages installed within the virtual environment, execute the following command:\n\npip list\n\n\n\n7. Installing Packages in the Virtual Environment\nTo install packages within the virtual environment, use the following command:\n\npip install package_name\n\n\n\n8. Creating a File of Packages and Versions\nTo create a file containing a list of installed packages and their versions, use the following command:\n\npip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\n\n\n\n9. Installing Packages from a Requirements File\nTo install packages from a requirements file, execute the following command:\n\npip install -r requirements.txt\n\n\n\n10. Deactivating the Virtual Environment\nTo deactivate the virtual environment and return to the global environment, use the following command:\n\ndeactivate \n\n\n\nConclusion\nThese basic Python commands provide a solid foundation for managing virtual environments and package installations. By utilizing virtual environments, you can isolate project dependencies and ensure consistent and reproducible development environments. Remember to create and commit a requirements.txt file for version control of your project’s dependencies, while excluding the virtual environment itself from version control."

    "text": "Using a R package called SQLite, this post demonstrates how to answer data related questions with both R and SQL (Structured Query Language).\n\n\n\nNaruto with SQL logo, and Sauske with the R Studio logo, standing back to back.\n\n\n\n0. Introduction\nThere are a handful of programming languages that data scientists use when querying, analyzing, and manipulating data. What I have found is that while R and Python have a lot more power in what they are capable of producing, SQL is used by a wider variety of roles to access and query data. So to get more practice using both SQL and R I pulled 10 questions and some data off a website called Learn SQL, and will be answering the following questions in both languages.\n\n0.0 Set-Up0.1 Packages0.2 Data0.3 Database\n\n\nContents:\n\n0.1 Packages\n0.2 Data\n0.3 Data base\n\n\n\nFor all my data queries and manipulation in R I will be using base R, dplyr, and magrittr.\n\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(magrittr)\n\nTo create a SQL database, and run SQL queries in R chunks I will be using a package called RSQLite.\n\n# install.packages(\"RSQLite\")\nlibrary(RSQLite)\n\n\n\nThis post will use three data sets that I copied from Learn SQL:\n\npatients: Which includes patient_id, first_name, last_name, gender, birth_date, city, province_id, allergies, height, and weight. Note I only copied the first 1000 entries.\n\n\npatients &lt;- utils::read.csv('data/patients.csv')\n\n\nprovince_names: Which includes province_id, and province_name.\n\n\nprovince_names &lt;- utils::read.csv(\"data/province_names.csv\")\n\n\nadmissions: which includes patient_id, admission_date, discharge_date, diagnosis, attending_doctor_id\n\n\nadmissions &lt;- utils::read.csv(\"data/admissions.csv\")\n\n\n\nTo create a database use:\n\ndbConnect() to connect to a SQL data base called Hospital.db in the 00_data folder.\nSQLite() to connect to a SQLite database file.\n\n\nhosp &lt;- RSQLite::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(),\n                           \"data/Hospital.db\")\n\nTo define data within the database use:\n\ndbWriteTable() to create a data set within the hospital database first call the data base (hosp), define a name, and then define the data.\n\n\nRSQLite::dbWriteTable(hosp,\n                      \"patients\",\n                      patients)\nRSQLite::dbWriteTable(hosp,\n                      \"province_names\",\n                      province_names)\nRSQLite::dbWriteTable(hosp,\n                      \"admissions\",\n                      admissions)\n\nVerify the three data sets are in the database using:\n\ndbListTables() to list the tables within the hosp database.\n\n\nRSQLite::dbListTables(hosp)\n\n[1] \"admissions\"     \"patients\"       \"province_names\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

Despite no snowfall, we erred on the side of caution, rescheduling plans for my partner Tanner’s family birthday dinner.\nSaturday Jan. 13th\nThe day started calmly but turned tumultuous as winds picked up in the afternoon, leading to a power outage by 3 PM. Seeking refuge at our local watering hole, we waited for an update from PGE that wouldn’t come for a few days. Enduring the biting cold again, we walked home, and huddled under blankets with our beloved cat, Lulu (as seen in the picture above).\nSunday Jan. 14th\nWith no updates from the power company, our day was spent navigating the cold reality of a powerless home. Concern for Lulu’s well-being prompted makeshift measures to retain heat, including burning old furniture and fortifying our living room against the chill. The fire went out after midnight, but the room still retained heat more than the other rooms in the house.\nMonday Jan. 15th\nAs another storm loomed on the horizon, we made the decision to seek shelter at Tanner’s mom’s house, braving treacherous roads with our faithful companion, Lulu. The drive marked the first communication from the power company for power to return 10PM Tuesday.\nTuesday Jan. 16th\nDespite the icy roads and uncertainty, we received a belated message of restored power at midnight. A modest birthday gift for Tanner amidst the challenges.\nWednesday Jan. 17th\nEager to return home, we cautiously navigated icy roads, only to be greeted by the aftermath of a flooded bathroom upon arrival. Despite intermittent power, we resolved to stay put, improvising with limited resources. PGE says power should be back on tomorrow night at 10PM.\nThursday Jan. 18th\nTanner ventured out in search of firewood checking multiple locations, only to find some at Lowes. Power was out all day, and did not return until 8pm.\nFriday Jan. 19th\nPower was on for most of the day, but went out twice in the later afternoon. Roads are icy, and un-drivable.\nSaturday - Sunday\nPower stayed on, but roads and sidewalks were still icy."

I chose “The Only Good Indians” specifically because I was unfamiliar with it, hoping to be genuinely surprised by the story’s twists. And indeed, I was not disappointed.\nFrom the first chapter, the novel sets a brisk pace and a tone that blends the ordinary with a sense of impending dread. The graphic content, while occasionally shocking, serves to intensify the atmosphere without overshadowing the plot. There’s a rich layer of mystery throughout the book, which I found thoroughly engaging and well worth the venture into this new genre."

    "text": "1.2. Cultural Identity and Heritage\nThe novel is not only a narrative about personal survival but also a profound exploration of the complexities of cultural identity. Jones showcases how traditions and ancient beliefs can persist in contemporary life, influencing the characters’ actions, their worldviews, and their interactions with both the spiritual and the physical worlds.\nThe heritage of the characters is not merely a backdrop but acts as a pivotal force in driving the plot and deepening the horror elements of the story. Through vivid descriptions and culturally specific details, Jones brings to life the distinct experiences of his characters, providing readers with a deeper understanding of their lives and the pressures they face from both within and outside their community.\nFurthermore, the book engages with the idea of legacy—what one generation passes down to the next and how these inheritances can shape lives in ways that are both visible and hidden. The reverence for traditional practices and the struggle with the ghosts of history are woven into the narrative, creating a rich tapestry that highlights the resilience and complexity of Native American life.\nBy embedding these themes in a horror context, Jones not only tells a thrilling story but also invites readers to reflect on the cultural struggles and triumphs of his characters, offering a poignant commentary on identity, community, and the indelible marks of heritage. This approach enriches the reader’s experience, providing not just suspense but a meaningful exploration of what cultural identity means in a modern world fraught with both past traumas and present challenges."

    "section": "1.3. Suvivor’s Guilt and Consequences of the Past",
    "text": "1.3. Suvivor’s Guilt and Consequences of the Past\nThe narrative is heavily centered on the concept of survivor’s guilt, where the characters are not only dealing with the immediate threats that emerge around them but also grappling with the emotional and psychological consequences of events that occurred many years prior. This guilt shapes their decisions, relationships, and perceptions of self, creating a tension that is both internal and external.\nThe consequences of past actions are portrayed as inescapable and lingering, suggesting that the past is never truly past but continues to influence the present in profound and often horrifying ways. The characters find themselves haunted not just by a supernatural presence but by the weight of their own memories and the choices they made. This intersection of personal history and supernatural consequence creates a compelling narrative that questions the possibility of ever truly escaping one’s actions.\nJones uses these themes to explore deeper societal issues as well, reflecting on how historical injustices and personal traumas are interlinked and how they continue to affect individuals and communities. The novel suggests that the horrors of the past are not easily forgotten and can resurface, sometimes monstrously, shaping the lives of those involved for years to come."

    "text": "1.4. Nature and Supernatural\nJones uses a blend of nature and the supernatural to explore themes of respect, desecration, and reconciliation. The natural world in “The Only Good Indians” is not just a passive setting but a dynamic force that interacts with the characters, influencing their lives and driving the narrative forward. This approach heightens the horror elements of the story, as the environment and its spirits become sources of tension and terror that the characters must navigate.\nThe supernatural occurrences in the novel are deeply tied to these natural settings, suggesting that the land itself holds memories and has the power to manifest them in ways that are both protective and punitive. This connection emphasizes the characters’ respect for and symbiosis with their environment, as well as the consequences when this balance is disrupted."

    "text": "1.5. Socail Commentary\nJones’s narrative is not just a horror story but also a poignant examination of the social issues that affect Native American people. Through the lives of his characters, the novel addresses themes such as systemic oppression, cultural erasure, and the struggles with identity that many indigenous people face. These elements are woven into the fabric of the story, reflecting real-world concerns in a manner that is both engaging and enlightening.\nThe horror elements of the book often serve as metaphors for the larger, more insidious fears that these communities contend with—such as the loss of cultural identity and the ongoing effects of historical traumas. The supernatural occurrences in the novel can be seen as manifestations of these larger societal issues, making the horror feel both immediate and deeply symbolic.\nJones also touches on resilience and the importance of community solidarity in facing these challenges. The characters’ responses to the supernatural threats are informed by their cultural heritage and collective experiences, showcasing the strength found in shared histories and traditions."

    "text": "1.6. The Horror of Everyday Life\nJones cleverly elevates everyday scenarios and settings to create vessels of horror. This technique not only blurs the lines between the ordinary and the supernatural but also heightens the tension and suspense throughout the novel. The familiar becomes sinister, turning the characters’ routine lives into a landscape where horror can emerge at any moment.\nThis theme serves as a powerful metaphor for the internal and external battles the characters face. The everyday struggles of the characters, who deal with issues like identity, cultural heritage, and personal demons, are amplified by the horror elements, suggesting that sometimes the real terror lies in the challenges we encounter daily.\nJones uses this setting to reflect on how the past continually shadows the present, making even simple decisions or encounters fraught with deeper meanings and potential dangers. The ordinary moments are depicted as being just as capable of producing fear and anxiety as the extraordinary ones, which makes the horror in the novel more relatable and unnerving."

    "text": "2.1. Title Significance\nThe title of Stephen Graham Jones’ novel, “The Only Good Indians,” carries profound thematic and symbolic weight, particularly as it echoes the historically violent phrase, “The only good Indian is a dead Indian.” This saying, which became popular in the late 19th century, reflects the brutal attitudes and genocidal sentiments directed toward Native American populations during the westward expansion in the United States. By choosing this title, Jones engages in a subversive act of linguistic reclamation, turning a phrase that epitomizes racial hatred into a critique of those very notions.\nThe novel itself mirrors the violence of this old saying, dealing with both the literal and metaphorical hauntings of the characters by their past actions and the broader historical injustices inflicted upon their ancestors. This reflection is not only about survival but also about the struggles of cultural identity in contemporary society, as the characters grapple with the implications of being considered a “good” Indian.\nThe irony of using such a historically derogatory statement as the title adds a layer of critique; through the stories of the characters, Jones highlights the resilience and humanity of Native American individuals, countering the dehumanizing undertones of the original phrase. The title also prompts readers to consider deeper moral and ethical questions about identity, redemption, and the nature of good and evil, challenging entrenched stereotypes and inviting a reexamination of the complexities that these judgments entail. Through this charged title, Jones ensures that the themes of historical context and contemporary reality are palpable, enriching the narrative to transcend horror and become a poignant commentary on society."

    "section": "2.2 Character Dynamics and Background",
    "text": "2.2 Character Dynamics and Background\nThis book offers a rich tapestry of character complexity and moral ambiguity, particularly through characters like Gabe and Victor Yellow Tail. These characters are depicted with depth and nuance, navigating a world where choices are often constrained by external forces and internal conflicts. This portrayal effectively showcases their roles as anti-heroes, individuals who grapple with their flaws and the moral complexities of their decisions.\nGabe, one of the four friends central to the story, exemplifies the anti-hero archetype. His life is marked by a blend of good intentions and flawed actions, creating a character that is both relatable and tragic. Gabe’s decisions are often influenced by the immediate needs and pressures of his environment, reflecting the limited choices available to him. His struggles with alcohol, his role as a father, and his attempts to maintain a semblance of normalcy in the face of haunting past actions all contribute to a portrait of a man caught between the desire for redemption and the pull of his circumstances. Gabe’s moral ambiguity is highlighted by his participation in the elk hunt that sets the tragic events of the novel in motion, an act driven by youth and rebellion that later returns to haunt him.\nVictor Yellow Tail, on the other hand, serves as a foil to the main group of friends. As a tribal police officer, Victor represents an uncomfortable intersection of community and authority who is seen as someone who has ostensibly made ‘better’ choices than his peers. His role as a law enforcer is doubly contentious as he is seen not just as upholding the law, but specifically as enforcing “the white man’s law” on reservation land. This position places him in a delicate balance between his duties and his cultural identity, making him a figure of both respect and resentment within the community. Victor’s interactions with the community, and his ultimate fate in the story, serve to underline the themes of justice and retribution that are central to the novel. His character raises questions about the nature of authority and righteousness within a community still grappling with its history and the ongoing challenges of its present.\nBoth Gabe and Victor, in their respective roles, navigate the world with a complex mixture of heroism and villainy. Their stories highlight the inherent challenges in defining morality within a community where historical injustices and personal failures intertwine. Through these characters, Jones explores the idea that morality is not a fixed state but a fluid dynamic, influenced by past actions, personal motivations, and the broader social and cultural forces at play."

    "section": "2.3. Cultural and Tribal Identities",
    "text": "2.3. Cultural and Tribal Identities\nAt the heart of the novel, the tensions between Crow and Blackfeet cultures are embodied in the characters and their backgrounds, subtly informing their interactions and conflicts. Jones does not explicitly detail the historical conflicts between the Crow and Blackfeet in the novel, but the weight of history is palpable in the characters’ lives. Historically, the Crow and Blackfeet were often in conflict over territory and resources, a backdrop that enriches the narrative’s tension. This history adds layers of meaning to the characters’ struggles with belonging and loyalty, highlighting how historical inter-tribal dynamics continue to affect contemporary relationships and self-perception.\nMoreover, the novel touches on the internalized prejudices and stereotypes that can prevail within and between Native American communities. Through the characters’ interactions and internal monologues, Jones subtly addresses how these historical animosities can lead to internalized racism and self-hatred, complicating the characters’ abilities to form a cohesive identity. The struggle for identity and acceptance is portrayed not just as an internal battle but as a challenge shaped by the long shadows of inter-tribal histories.\nIn tying these personal and inter-tribal tensions to the broader themes of the novel, Jones skillfully uses the horror genre as a metaphorical landscape to discuss cultural disintegration and identity conflicts."

    "title": "Book Review: The Only Good Indians",
    "section": "2.4. Symbolism and Mirroring",
    "text": "2.4. Symbolism and Mirroring\nThe illegal elk hunt that the characters partake in their youth serves as a critical symbol in the novel. This act of killing a pregnant elk in a restricted area is not only a breach of legal and cultural norms but also a violation of sacred life, which mirrors the historical violence inflicted upon Native American communities. This act of violence against nature symbolically represents the broader violence against Native Americans—both are acts of invasion and disrespect against beings seen as lesser by an oppressive force. The elk, particularly because it was pregnant, symbolizes not just life but potential life, reflecting the deep cuts made into the fabric of Native communities, where not only lives were taken but potential futures were destroyed.\nThe mirroring effect is a powerful tool used by Jones to draw parallels between individual actions and historical events. By aligning the slaughter of the elk with the genocidal history faced by Native Americans, the novel invites readers to reflect on the cyclical nature of violence and the ways in which historical injustices continue to resonate in contemporary settings. The characters’ personal guilt and the supernatural retribution they face are not just about their actions but also about their roles within these larger historical cycles. They become stand-ins for broader cultural narratives, living out themes of retribution and guilt that have been part of their heritage."

    "section": "2.5. The Elk-Headed Woman",
    "text": "2.5. The Elk-Headed Woman\nAs a figure of horror, the Elk-Headed Woman is terrifying and relentless. Her appearances are marked by a chilling blend of the natural and the supernatural, as she combines elements of a vengeful spirit and a wronged animal. Her pursuit of the main characters, who were responsible for the death of her elk form and her unborn calf during an illegal hunt, is both brutal and ghostly, imbuing the story with a palpable sense of dread and inevitability. Her actions are gruesome and her presence suffuses the novel with a tension that is typical of horror but with an added layer of psychological depth. This depth comes from her motivations, which unfold as the story progresses, reshaping the reader’s understanding of her role in the narrative.\nThe revelation of the Elk-Headed Woman’s desire for her lost baby introduces profound themes of motherhood and loss, adding layers to her character that extend beyond mere vengeance. This aspect of her motivation reveals her actions not just as blind revenge but as a mother’s grief-stricken response to the violent loss of her child. In this light, her relentless pursuit of the men reflects the depth of her loss and the lengths to which she will go for what she sees as reconciliation or retribution. This revelation complicates the reader’s perception of her as merely a villain, inviting a more empathetic understanding of her fury and actions.\nMoreover, the Elk-Headed Woman’s presence and motivations are deeply intertwined with the characters’ feelings of guilt and the symbolic weight of their past actions. She embodies the consequences of their youthful indiscretions, transforming their guilt into a literal haunting that stalks them throughout their lives. This connection emphasizes the theme that the past is never truly past when its wounds remain unaddressed. The Elk-Headed Woman, therefore, stands as a constant reminder of the characters’ responsibility for their actions and the pain they have caused."

    "section": "2.6. The Final Girl",
    "text": "2.6. The Final Girl\nIn the novel, Denora is positioned as the “final girl.” Unlike the typical final girl trope where the character often begins as somewhat innocent or unassuming, Denora’s role is steeped in cultural identity and personal resilience from the outset. She is not only a survivor but also a representation of a new generation grappling with both the legacy of the past and the pressures of the present.\nDenora’s confrontation with the Elk Head Woman during the climactic scenes of the book redefines the trope. Here, the antagonist is not merely a slasher or a faceless monster but a manifestation of cultural trauma and historical violence. The Elk Head Woman is a symbol of the consequences that come from the characters’ disconnection from their traditions and their community.\nDenora’s showdown with this spirit is significant because it is not just about physical survival but about cultural survival and identity. Her role as the final girl underscores a thematic focus on healing and reconciliation. It highlights the possibility of overcoming generational traumas through understanding and facing the horrors of the past directly.\nThis confrontation also shifts the perspective on how strength and vulnerability are portrayed in horror narratives. Denora’s strength comes from her deep connection to her culture and her ability to face the truth of her community’s and her ancestors’ actions. This makes her survival not just a personal victory but a communal hope for renewal and change.\nBy placing Denora at the center of this final confrontation, Jones not only subverts the traditional final girl trope but enriches it, making it a vehicle for deeper commentary on resilience, identity, and redemption within Native American communities. Her survival is symbolic of the broader survival and adaptation of her culture, offering a powerful message about the endurance of heritage and the strength found in facing one’s history."

    "text": "Rating: 3/10  Overview: Offers basic insights from 1936 with a tone of its era.\n\n\nIntroduction\nIn the landscape of personal development and interpersonal skills, few books have stood the test of time as prominently as Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” Despite its age, the core principles Carnegie presents remain remarkably relevant, addressing the timeless human desire for connection and understanding. However, it’s not without its controversies; some readers may find its techniques manipulative, and some of Carnegie’s idols (such as Robert E. Lee and John D. Rockefeller) and sexitst pro-capitalist ideals problematic.\nIn the following, I share my notes - a compilation of quotes and insights that I found particularly striking. These reflections are intended to capture the essence of Carnegie’s advice through my lens, underscoring its potential wisdom.\n\n\nPart One: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People\nThis section covers the basic principles of interacting with others, emphasizing the importance of avoiding criticism, condemnation, or complaints.\n\nBy criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.\nDon’t criticize them, they are doing just as you would under similar circumstances.\nAny fool can criticize, complain, and condemn—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.\nTell me what makes you feel important and I’ll tell you the type of person you are.\n\n\n\nI learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.\n\nJohn Wanamaker\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge not, that ye be not judeged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n\nMatthew 7:1-3\n\n\n\n\n\nI will speak ill of no one. I will speak all the good I know of everybody.\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand all is to forgive all.\n\nEvelyn Waugh\n\n\n\n\n\nI shall not pass this way again, so when I do it let me be kind.\n\nEtienne de Grellet\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Two: Six Ways to Make People Like You\nHere, Carnegie presents simple strategies to become more likable and build stronger, more positive relationships with others.\n\nBecome genuinely interested in other people.\n\nYou can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people that in 2 years by trying to get other people interested in you.\nIt is the individual who is not interested in their fellow man that has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It’s from those individuals that all human failures spring.\nIf the author doesn’t like people, than people won’t like their stories.\nWe all like people who admire us.\n“I love my audience.”\n\n\n\nEvery man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn from him.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson\n\n\n\nSmile.\n\nEncouragement is more effective teaching device than punishment.\nStop talking about what you want, and see things from other peoples sides.\nAct and speak as if cheerfulness is already there.\nHappiness depends on inside conditions. It is what you think about it.\nTo think rightly is to create.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\n\nShakespeare\n\n\n\n\n\nWe become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis.\n\nJeffrey J. Denning\n\n\n\nRemember that people like hearing their name.\nBe a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.\nTalk in terms of the other person’s interests.\nMake the other person feel important and do it sincerely.\n\nOil the cogs with little things such as please, thank you, if you don’t mind, and so on.\nRecognize other people’s importance and recognize it sincerely.\nTalk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.\n\n\n\nThe deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.\n\nJohn Dewey\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.\n\nWilliam James\n\n\n\n\n\nDo unto others how you would have others do unto you.\n\nMathew 7:12\n\n\n\n\n\nBut man, proud man, Drest in a little brief authority, Most ignorant of what he’s most assur’d; His glassy essence, like an angry ape, Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, As make the angels weep.\n\nShakespeare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Three: How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking\nThis part offers tactics for persuading others to your point of view without causing offense or arousing resentment.\n\nThe best way to win an argument is to avoid it.\n\nYou can’t win an argument.\nDistrust your first impression.\nWelcome the disagreement.\nWhen two partners always agree then one of them is not necessary.\nPerhaps there is something you haven’t thought about. Be thankful it’s been brought to your attention.\nWatch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best.\nYou can measure the size of a person by what makes them angry.\nBuild bridges of understanding, not barriers of misunderstanding.\nDwell on areas where you agree with others.\nPromise to think over their ideas and mean it. It’s easier to agree to think about their points.\nThank your opponents sincerely for their interests. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are.\nThink of your opponents as people who want to help you. Think of your opponents as your friends.\nWhen one person is yelling the other should be listening because when two people yell then no one is listening.\n\nQuestions to Ask Yourself\n\nCould my opponents be right or partially right?\nIs there truth or merit in their position or argument?\nIs my reaction one that will relieve the problem, or just relieve my frustration?\nWill my reaction draw my opponents further away or closer to me?\nWill my reaction demonstrate the estimation of good will people have of me?\nWill I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win?\nIf I am quiet about it will the disagreement blow over?\nIs this difficult situation an opportunity for me?\n\n\n\nIf you argue you will never have a person’s good will.\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\n\n\n\n\nHere lies the body of William Jay, Who died maintaining his right of way— He was right, dead right, as he sped along, But he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.\n\nCarnege\n\n\n\n\n\nHatred is never ended by hatered, but by love.\n\nBuddah\n\n\n\n\n\nYield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\n\n\nShow respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say “You’re wrong”.\n\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t make anybody know it.\nBe wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.\nWhen you argue you are not persuading.\nRidicule and abuse never make someone agree with you.\nBenjamin Franklin never spoke in certainties.\nReply to your opposition stating that in some cases you could see their perspective being right. You could also see some cases in which that is not the case.\nConversations will go more pleasantly and a modest suggestion will be better received.\nYou will have less mortification when found to be in the wrong, and more people to agree with you when you are right.\nMake it a point not to disagree or tell the other person they are wrong.\nBeing diplomatic will help you gain your point.\n\n\n\nMen must be taught as if you taught them not, and thing proposed as things forgot.\n\nAlexander Pope\n\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot teach a man anything, only help him find it within himself.\n\nGalileo\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told that we are wrong we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened.\n\nJames harvey Robinson, The Mind in the Making\n\n\n\n\n\nBen you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for everyone who differs with you. They have become so offensive that nobody cares for them. Your friends find that they enjoy themselves better when you are not around. You know so much that no one can tell you anything. Indeed no one is going to try for the act and effort would only lead to discomfort and hard work. Therefore you are likely never to know anymore than you do now, which is very little.\n\nQuote from Benjamin Franklins Autobiography\n\n\n\n\n\nI judge people by their principles not by my own.\n\nMLK\n\n\n\n\n\nAgree with thyn adversary quickly.\n\nJesus\n\n\n\nIf you are wrong admit it quickly and emphatically.\n\nWhen you say the other person’s criticism of yourself first, then the criticism is coming from your mouth, and the blow will be much softer.\nAny fool can defend their mistakes, but it takes a large person to discuss failure.\nBy fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.\n\nBegin in a friendly way.\n\nGentleness and friendliness are stronger than brute force.\n\n\n\nIf you come at me with your fists doubled, I think I can promise you that mine will double as fast as yours; but if you come to me and say, ‘Let us sit down and take counsel together, and, if we differ from each other, understand why it is that we differ, just what the points at issue are,’ we will presently find that we are not so far apart after all, that the points on which we differ are few and the points on which we agree are many, and that if we only have the patience and the candor and the desire to get together, we will get together.\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\nA drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\n\n\nGet the other person saying “yes yes” immediately.\n\nBegin and keep on emphasizing the things on which you agree. You are both striving for the same end, but your only difference is of method not of purpose.\nA no response is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have said no, all your pride and personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself.\nIt takes more force to go in the opposite direction.\nWhen someone says no they are doing more than that. The body is doing more than that. When a person says yes, no physical or mental withdraw happens.\nA skillful speaker gets a yes response.\nThe more yeses we can receive, the more likely we are to succeed at capturing our proposal.\nThe Socratic method is based on getting a yes response.\nAsk gentle questions to get a yes response.\nHe who treads softly goes far.\n\nLet the other person do a great deal of the talking.\n\nLet the other person talk themselves out.\n\nLet the other person feel the idea is theirs.\nTry honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.\n\nSuccess when dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s viewpoint.\nCooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own.\nThink always in terms of the other person’s point of view.\n\nBe sympathetic to the other person’s ideas and desires.\n\nI don’t blame you for feeling how you do, and if I were you I would feel as you do.\n\n\nThere but for the grace of god go I.\nProverb\n\nAppeal to the nobler motives.\n\nBasically there is a real reason why someone does something, and then the reason they tell people (the nobler reason). Appeal to these reasons.\nStory about a guy who didn’t want a specific picture of him in the paper, but wrote a letter saying that it was his mother who did not like this picture. Appealing to the nobler motive of respecting a mothers wishes.\n\nDramatize your ideas.\n\nShow your point, don’t just explain it.\n\nThrow down a challenge.\n\nMotivate with friendly competition.\n\n\n\n\nPart Four: Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arrousing Resentment\nThe final section focuses on leadership and how to encourage others to change their behavior or beliefs in a positive way.\n\nBeing a leader often involves changing people’s behaviors and attitudes.\n\n\nBegin with praise and honest appreciation.\nCall attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.\nTalk about your own mistakes before criticizing others.\nAsk questions instead of giving direct orders.\nLet the other person save face.\nPraise the slightest improvement, and praise every improvement. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.\nGive the other person a fine reputation to live up to.\n\n\nAssume a virtue if you have it not.\n\nShakespeare\n\n\n\nUse encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.\nMake the other person happy about doing the thing that you suggest.\n“Playbook”\n\nBe sincere, and do not promise anything.\nKnow what you want the other person to do.\nBe empathetic, and ask what the other person wants.\nWhat are the benefits the other person will get doing what you want?\nMatch those benefits to the things that they want.\nWhen you make your request, put it in a form that they personally will benefit from doing this.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nDale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People” provides a foundational perspective on the art of interaction and persuasion. While its age-old advice resonates with timeless truths about human nature, the modern reader must navigate its principles with a critical eye."
