    "text": "Timeline of Events\nFriday, Jan. 12th\nA winter storm watch for the weekend warned of cold weather and snow. Despite no snowfall, we erred on the side of caution, rescheduling plans for my partner Tanner’s family birthday dinner.\nSaturday Jan. 13th\nThe day started calmly but turned tumultuous as winds picked up in the afternoon, leading to a power outage by 3 PM. Seeking refuge at our local watering hole, we waited for an update from PGE that wouldn’t come for a few days. Enduring the biting cold again, we walked home, and huddled under blankets with our beloved cat, Lulu (as seen in the picture above).\nSunday Jan. 14th\nWith no updates from the power company, our day was spent navigating the cold reality of a powerless home. Concern for Lulu’s well-being prompted makeshift measures to retain heat, including burning old furniture and fortifying our living room against the chill. The fire went out after midnight, but the room still retained heat more than the other rooms in the house.\nMonday Jan. 15th\nAs another storm loomed on the horizon, we made the decision to seek shelter at Tanner’s mom’s house, braving treacherous roads with our faithful companion, Lulu. The drive marked the first communication from the power company for power to return 10PM Tuesday.\nTuesday Jan. 16th\nDespite the icy roads and uncertainty, we received a belated message of restored power at midnight. A modest birthday gift for Tanner amidst the challenges.\nWednesday Jan. 17th\nEager to return home, we cautiously navigated icy roads, only to be greeted by the aftermath of a flooded bathroom upon arrival. Despite intermittent power, we resolved to stay put, improvising with limited resources. PGE says power should be back on tomorrow night at 10PM.\nThursday Jan. 18th\nTanner ventured out in search of firewood checking multiple locations, only to find some at Lowes. Power was out all day, and did not return until 8pm.\nFriday Jan. 19th\nPower was on for most of the day, but went out twice in the later afternoon. Roads are icy, and un-drivable.\nSaturday - Sunday\nPower stayed on, but roads and sidewalks were still icy."

So, if you’re looking how to learn how to work with this data, lessons are already available! Data is available through Figshare.\nCITATION: Woodhouse, Philip; Veldwisch, Gert Jan; Brockington, Daniel; Komakech, Hans C.; Manjichi, Angela; Venot, Jean-Philippe (2018): SAFI Survey Results. doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.6262019.v1\n\nSAFI (Studying African Farmer-Led Irrigation) is a currently running project which is looking at farming and irrigation methods. This is survey data relating to households and agriculture in Tanzania and Mozambique. The survey data was collected through interviews conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 using forms downloaded to Android Smartphones. The survey forms were created using the ODK (Open Data Kit) software via an Excel spreadsheet. The collected data is then sent back to a central server. The server can be used to download the collected data in both JSON and CSV formats. This is a teaching version of the collected data that we will be using. It is not the full dataset.\n\n\nThe survey covered such things as; household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household members), agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), assets (e.g. number and types of livestock) and details about the household members.\n\n\nThe basic teaching dataset used in these lessons is a subset of the JSON dataset that has been converted into CSV format.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nThis week in the index.R file I tried using the tidytuesdayR package and the variable week <- c(24) in attempt to streamline updating the index file for future weeks.

Will need to do more research on this in future weeks.\nWhen I use the showtext package to assign fonts to the text on my graphs and go to save them as a .png file, if I don’t update the dpi = value (dots per inch) then I have huge spaces in between lines of text. I found that the larger the dpi value the more space there is between lines of text. 150 dpi seems to be a good dpi for this graph.\nI am still debating using the TidyTuesdayR package. It is nice to have the link to the .csv file avaialble in the code."

    "text": "Verified Oldest People\nThe data this week comes from the Wikipedia List of the verified oldest people via frankiethull on GitHub. Thank you for the submission, Frank!\n\nThese are lists of the 100 known verified oldest people sorted in descending order by age in years and days. The oldest person ever whose age has been independently verified is Jeanne Calment (1875–1997) of France, who lived to the age of 122 years and 164 days. The oldest verified man ever is Jiroemon Kimura (1897–2013) of Japan, who lived to the age of 116 years and 54 days. The oldest known living person is Maria Branyas of Spain, aged 116 years, 85 days. The oldest known living man is Juan Vicente Pérez of Venezuela, aged 114 years, 1 day. The 100 oldest women have, on average, lived several years longer than the 100 oldest men.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nThis week I wanted to do more to spice up a bar plot.

Then in the visualize package I assigned the fill aesthetic to the “to_highlight” column.\nTo curve the edges of the boxes (so they look more like tombstones) in the styling file I used ggchicklet::geom_chicklet() to assign a curved radius of 3 milimeters.\nTo angle the labels on the x-axis I used ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25)).\nSpacing is a little funky, but I think it might work for this visual.\nFrequentist data visuals seem to be the low hanging fruit for these Tid Tuesday submissions, and my goal is to push onto more predictive and model based visual analysis by the end of the summer."

    "text": "UFO Sightings Redux\nThe data this week comes from the National UFO Reporting Center, cleaned and enriched with data from sunrise-sunset.org by Jon Harmon.\nIf this dataset looks familiar, that’s because we used a version of it back in 2019. The new version adds the last several years of data, adds information about time-of-day, and cleans up some errors in the original dataset. We’d love to see visualizations describing the differences between the 2019 dataset and this new dataset!\n\nThe National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 170,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nThis weeks code retains its core components of cleaning, visualizing, and styling, while the index.R file handles data loading, file execution, and the generation of a data visualization.\n\nCleaningVisualizeStyleindex.RLinks\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\n#### Load Packages ####\n# magrittr: %>% pipe function. \n# dplyr: data cleaning functions.\n# tidyr: data manipulation functions.\nbase::library(dplyr)\nbase::library(magrittr)\nbase::library(tidyr)\n\n#### Cleaning Function ####\nclean <- function(df){\n  # Filter date for Oregon\n  or_df <- df %>%\n    dplyr::filter(state == c(\"OR\")) %>%\n    dplyr::reframe(\n      shape = shape, \n      duration_seconds = duration_seconds,\n      duration_minutes = duration_seconds/60)\n  # remove nas \n  or_df$duration_seconds <- stats::na.omit(or_df$duration_seconds)\n  # Subset for all data 5 minutes or less\n  clean_df <- \n    base::subset(or_df, \n                 duration_seconds < 301) %>%\n    tidyr::replace_na(list(shape = c(\"not available\")))\n    \n  return(clean_df)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\n#### Load Packages ####\nbase::library(ggplot2)\n\n#### Visual Function ####\nvis <- function(clean_df){\n  vis <- ggplot2::ggplot(\n    clean_df,\n    ggplot2::aes(x = shape,\n                 y = duration_minutes,\n                 fill = shape,\n                 color = shape)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +\n    ggplot2::geom_jitter(\n      na.rm = TRUE, \n      color = \"#d2ff46\", \n      alpha = 0.7)\n  return(vis)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\n#### Load Packages ####\n# ggplot2: graphing functions.\n# showtext: font functions. \nbase::library(\"ggplot2\")\nbase::library(\"showtext\")\n\n#### Load Fonts ####\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Orbitron\", \"font\")\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n\n#### Load Colors ####\ncol1 <- \"#d2ff46\"\ncol2 <- \"#0d0d0d\"\ncol3 <- \"white\"\n\n#### Axis Labels ####\naxis_labs <- c(\"changing\", \"orb\", \"formation\", \"oval\", \"unknown\",\n               \"cigar\", \"rectangle\", \"circle\", \"egg\", \"sphere\", \n               \"other\", \"light\", \"triangle\", \"teardrop\", \"cross\",\n               \"diamond\", \"cylinder\", \"disk\", \"fireball\", \"not available\", \n               \"flash\", \"chevron\", \"cone\")\n\n#### Style Function ####\nsty <- function(vis){\n  sty <- vis +\n    # labs\n    ggplot2::labs(\n      title = \"Shapes in Oregon: Short Sightings\",\n      subtitle = \"\\nThe following box plot displays the distribution of UFO sightings lasting less than 5 minutes in Oregon, categorized by \\ntheir reported shape.

Since the data points represent estimates of sighting durations, and they are mostly in minutes rather than specific seconds, using geom_point() would result in straight lines of dots across the box plots. Therefore, I decided to apply jittering using geom_jitter() to add some randomness to the point positions, which I deemed acceptable for visualizing the estimated sighting durations.\nIn the styling function, I utilized ggplot2::scale_x_discrete(limits = axis_labs) to define the order of the x-axis labels. Note that if you misspell a word, the data will not appear on your graph.\nAs the styling function grows longer, I find myself considering the idea of splitting it up. One approach I might explore is separating the labels into their own distinct function. This way, I can assess whether this change significantly improves the readability of the styling function.\nThis visual raises some concerns, and I acknowledge the need to allocate more time for statistical analysis in the future. The following issues can be identified with this visual.\n\n\nLack of statistical significance in the arrangement of UFO shapes along the x-axis: The order was chosen based on aesthetic and readability considerations, rather than any statistical criteria.\nAbsence of statistical analysis for outlier elimination: Since the data was limited to sightings lasting 5 minutes or less, no statistical analysis was conducted to identify and eliminate outliers."

The last sentence explains how the visual works.\nThe interactive features of the visual include: (1) a drop-down menu located beside the “GRADE” title that allows users to switch between “GUN LAW STRENGTH,” “GUN DEATH RANK,” and “GUN DEATH RATE”; (2) the ability to hover over each state with a mouse, revealing its grade, strength, or rank; and (3) pop-up windows that provide a more detailed analysis of each state."

This visual style would make it easier for the reader to notice that both “Access to Guns” and “Other Gun Safety Laws” have 14 new laws in 2022. Similarly the “Domestic Violence” and “Gun Dealer Regulations” both have 6 new gun laws in 2022."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the landscape of personal development and interpersonal skills, few books have stood the test of time as prominently as Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” Despite its age, the core principles Carnegie presents remain remarkably relevant, addressing the timeless human desire for connection and understanding. However, it’s not without its controversies; some readers may find its techniques manipulative, and some of Carnegie’s idols (such as Robert E. Lee and John D. Rockefeller) and sexitst pro-capitalist ideals problematic.\nIn the following, I share my notes - a compilation of quotes and insights that I found particularly striking. These reflections are intended to capture the essence of Carnegie’s advice through my lens, underscoring its potential wisdom.\n\n\nPart One: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People\nThis section covers the basic principles of interacting with others, emphasizing the importance of avoiding criticism, condemnation, or complaints.\n\nBy criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.\nDon’t criticize them, they are doing just as you would under similar circumstances.\nAny fool can criticize, complain, and condemn—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.\nTell me what makes you feel important and I’ll tell you the type of person you are.\n\n\n\nI learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.\n\nJohn Wanamaker\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge not, that ye be not judeged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n\nMatthew 7:1-3\n\n\n\n\n\nI will speak ill of no one. I will speak all the good I know of everybody.\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand all is to forgive all.\n\nEvelyn Waugh\n\n\n\n\n\nI shall not pass this way again, so when I do it let me be kind.\n\nEtienne de Grellet\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Two: Six Ways to Make People Like You\nHere, Carnegie presents simple strategies to become more likable and build stronger, more positive relationships with others.\n\nBecome genuinely interested in other people.\n\nYou can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people that in 2 years by trying to get other people interested in you.\nIt is the individual who is not interested in their fellow man that has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It’s from those individuals that all human failures spring.\nIf the author doesn’t like people, than people won’t like their stories.\nWe all like people who admire us.\n“I love my audience.”\n\n\n\nEvery man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn from him.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson\n\n\n\nSmile.\n\nEncouragement is more effective teaching device than punishment.\nStop talking about what you want, and see things from other peoples sides.\nAct and speak as if cheerfulness is already there.\nHappiness depends on inside conditions. It is what you think about it.\nTo think rightly is to create.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\n\nShakespeare\n\n\n\n\n\nWe become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis.\n\nJeffrey J. Denning\n\n\n\nRemember that people like hearing their name.\nBe a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.\nTalk in terms of the other person’s interests.\nMake the other person feel important and do it sincerely.\n\nOil the cogs with little things such as please, thank you, if you don’t mind, and so on.\nRecognize other people’s importance and recognize it sincerely.\nTalk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.\n\n\n\nThe deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.\n\nJohn Dewey\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.\n\nWilliam James\n\n\n\n\n\nDo unto others how you would have others do unto you.\n\nMathew 7:12\n\n\n\n\n\nBut man, proud man, Drest in a little brief authority, Most ignorant of what he’s most assur’d; His glassy essence, like an angry ape, Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, As make the angels weep.\n\nShakespeare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Three: How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking\nThis part offers tactics for persuading others to your point of view without causing offense or arousing resentment.\n\nThe best way to win an argument is to avoid it.\n\nYou can’t win an argument.\nDistrust your first impression.\nWelcome the disagreement.\nWhen two partners always agree then one of them is not necessary.\nPerhaps there is something you haven’t thought about. Be thankful it’s been brought to your attention.\nWatch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best.\nYou can measure the size of a person by what makes them angry.\nBuild bridges of understanding, not barriers of misunderstanding.\nDwell on areas where you agree with others.\nPromise to think over their ideas and mean it. It’s easier to agree to think about their points.\nThank your opponents sincerely for their interests. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are.\nThink of your opponents as people who want to help you. Think of your opponents as your friends.\nWhen one person is yelling the other should be listening because when two people yell then no one is listening.\n\nQuestions to Ask Yourself\n\nCould my opponents be right or partially right?\nIs there truth or merit in their position or argument?\nIs my reaction one that will relieve the problem, or just relieve my frustration?\nWill my reaction draw my opponents further away or closer to me?\nWill my reaction demonstrate the estimation of good will people have of me?\nWill I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win?\nIf I am quiet about it will the disagreement blow over?\nIs this difficult situation an opportunity for me?\n\n\n\nIf you argue you will never have a person’s good will.\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\n\n\n\n\nHere lies the body of William Jay, Who died maintaining his right of way— He was right, dead right, as he sped along, But he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.\n\nCarnege\n\n\n\n\n\nHatred is never ended by hatered, but by love.\n\nBuddah\n\n\n\n\n\nYield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\n\n\nShow respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say “You’re wrong”.\n\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t make anybody know it.\nBe wiser than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.\nWhen you argue you are not persuading.\nRidicule and abuse never make someone agree with you.\nBenjamin Franklin never spoke in certainties.\nReply to your opposition stating that in some cases you could see their perspective being right. You could also see some cases in which that is not the case.\nConversations will go more pleasantly and a modest suggestion will be better received.\nYou will have less mortification when found to be in the wrong, and more people to agree with you when you are right.\nMake it a point not to disagree or tell the other person they are wrong.\nBeing diplomatic will help you gain your point.\n\n\n\nMen must be taught as if you taught them not, and thing proposed as things forgot.\n\nAlexander Pope\n\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot teach a man anything, only help him find it within himself.\n\nGalileo\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told that we are wrong we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened.\n\nJames harvey Robinson, The Mind in the Making\n\n\n\n\n\nBen you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for everyone who differs with you. They have become so offensive that nobody cares for them. Your friends find that they enjoy themselves better when you are not around. You know so much that no one can tell you anything. Indeed no one is going to try for the act and effort would only lead to discomfort and hard work. Therefore you are likely never to know anymore than you do now, which is very little.\n\nQuote from Benjamin Franklins Autobiography\n\n\n\n\n\nI judge people by their principles not by my own.\n\nMLK\n\n\n\n\n\nAgree with thyn adversary quickly.\n\nJesus\n\n\n\nIf you are wrong admit it quickly and emphatically.\n\nWhen you say the other person’s criticism of yourself first, then the criticism is coming from your mouth, and the blow will be much softer.\nAny fool can defend their mistakes, but it takes a large person to discuss failure.\nBy fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.\n\nBegin in a friendly way.\n\nGentleness and friendliness are stronger than brute force.\n\n\n\nIf you come at me with your fists doubled, I think I can promise you that mine will double as fast as yours; but if you come to me and say, ‘Let us sit down and take counsel together, and, if we differ from each other, understand why it is that we differ, just what the points at issue are,’ we will presently find that we are not so far apart after all, that the points on which we differ are few and the points on which we agree are many, and that if we only have the patience and the candor and the desire to get together, we will get together.\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\nA drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\n\n\nGet the other person saying “yes yes” immediately.\n\nBegin and keep on emphasizing the things on which you agree. You are both striving for the same end, but your only difference is of method not of purpose.\nA no response is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have said no, all your pride and personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself.\nIt takes more force to go in the opposite direction.\nWhen someone says no they are doing more than that. The body is doing more than that. When a person says yes, no physical or mental withdraw happens.\nA skillful speaker gets a yes response.\nThe more yeses we can receive, the more likely we are to succeed at capturing our proposal.\nThe Socratic method is based on getting a yes response.\nAsk gentle questions to get a yes response.\nHe who treads softly goes far.\n\nLet the other person do a great deal of the talking.\n\nLet the other person talk themselves out.\n\nLet the other person feel the idea is theirs.\nTry honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.\n\nSuccess when dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s viewpoint.\nCooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own.\nThink always in terms of the other person’s point of view.\n\nBe sympathetic to the other person’s ideas and desires.\n\nI don’t blame you for feeling how you do, and if I were you I would feel as you do.\n\n\nThere but for the grace of god go I.\nProverb\n\nAppeal to the nobler motives.\n\nBasically there is a real reason why someone does something, and then the reason they tell people (the nobler reason). Appeal to these reasons.\nStory about a guy who didn’t want a specific picture of him in the paper, but wrote a letter saying that it was his mother who did not like this picture. Appealing to the nobler motive of respecting a mothers wishes.\n\nDramatize your ideas.\n\nShow your point, don’t just explain it.\n\nThrow down a challenge.\n\nMotivate with friendly competition.\n\n\n\n\nPart Four: Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arrousing Resentment\nThe final section focuses on leadership and how to encourage others to change their behavior or beliefs in a positive way.\n\nBeing a leader often involves changing people’s behaviors and attitudes.\n\n\nBegin with praise and honest appreciation.\nCall attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.\nTalk about your own mistakes before criticizing others.\nAsk questions instead of giving direct orders.\nLet the other person save face.\nPraise the slightest improvement, and praise every improvement. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.\nGive the other person a fine reputation to live up to.\n\n\nAssume a virtue if you have it not.\n\nShakespeare\n\n\n\nUse encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.\nMake the other person happy about doing the thing that you suggest.\n“Playbook”\n\nBe sincere, and do not promise anything.\nKnow what you want the other person to do.\nBe empathetic, and ask what the other person wants.\nWhat are the benefits the other person will get doing what you want?\nMatch those benefits to the things that they want.\nWhen you make your request, put it in a form that they personally will benefit from doing this.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nDale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People” provides a foundational perspective on the art of interaction and persuasion. While its age-old advice resonates with timeless truths about human nature, the modern reader must navigate its principles with a critical eye."

I am using a slightly modified version compared to Ted’s, necessitating adjustments to the code below.\n\n\nShow code\n# Load Data\ncereals <- readr::read_csv(\"../../../../data/cereal.csv\") |>\n  # clean names by converting to lowercase, replace spaces \n  # with underscore and removes special characters\n  janitor::clean_names() |>\n  # make shelf an ordered factor\n  dplyr::mutate(shelf = factor(shelf, ordered = TRUE)) |>\n  # convert mfr and type columns to categorical data\n  dplyr::mutate(across(c(\"mfr\", \"type\"), as.factor))\n\n\n\nOverall Summary\nBefore getting into the skimr package, let’s start with a traditional summary of the dataset:\n\n\nShow code\nsummary(cereals)\n\n\n     name           mfr    type      calories        protein     \n Length:77          A: 1   C:74   Min.   : 50.0   Min.   :1.000  \n Class :character   G:22   H: 3   1st Qu.:100.0   1st Qu.:2.000  \n Mode  :character   K:23          Median :110.0   Median :3.000  \n                    N: 6          Mean   :106.9   Mean   :2.545  \n                    P: 9          3rd Qu.:110.0   3rd Qu.:3.000  \n                    Q: 8          Max.   :160.0   Max.   :6.000  \n                    R: 8                                         \n      fat            sodium          fiber            carbo     \n Min.   :0.000   Min.   :  0.0   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   :-1.0  \n 1st Qu.:0.000   1st Qu.:130.0   1st Qu.: 1.000   1st Qu.:12.0  \n Median :1.000   Median :180.0   Median : 2.000   Median :14.0  \n Mean   :1.013   Mean   :159.7   Mean   : 2.152   Mean   :14.6  \n 3rd Qu.:2.000   3rd Qu.:210.0   3rd Qu.: 3.000   3rd Qu.:17.0  \n Max.   :5.000   Max.   :320.0   Max.   :14.000   Max.   :23.0  \n                                                                \n     sugars           potass          vitamins      shelf      weight    \n Min.   :-1.000   Min.   : -1.00   Min.   :  0.00   1:20   Min.   :0.50  \n 1st Qu.: 3.000   1st Qu.: 40.00   1st Qu.: 25.00   2:21   1st Qu.:1.00  \n Median : 7.000   Median : 90.00   Median : 25.00   3:36   Median :1.00  \n Mean   : 6.922   Mean   : 96.08   Mean   : 28.25          Mean   :1.03  \n 3rd Qu.:11.000   3rd Qu.:120.00   3rd Qu.: 25.00          3rd Qu.:1.00  \n Max.   :15.000   Max.   :330.00   Max.   :100.00          Max.   :1.50  \n                                                                         \n      cups           rating     \n Min.   :0.250   Min.   :18.04  \n 1st Qu.:0.670   1st Qu.:33.17  \n Median :0.750   Median :40.40  \n Mean   :0.821   Mean   :42.67  \n 3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:50.83  \n Max.   :1.500   Max.   :93.70  \n                                \n\n\nThe above summary provides a wealth of information. For columns designated as factors (mfr, type, and shelf), we observe counts for each category. Other column types display quantiles.\nNow, let’s utilize skimr::skim to generate a condensed summary of the dataset:\n\n\nShow code\nskim_output <- skimr::skim(cereals)\nsummary(skim_output)\n\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\ncereals\n\n\nNumber of rows\n77\n\n\nNumber of columns\n16\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nfactor\n3\n\n\nnumeric\n12\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\nThis condensed summary, as Ted aptly notes, offers a more succinct overview. Discrepancies in variable counts by type often signal the need for variable transformation. Personally, I find this approach invaluable, especially when dealing with datasets containing numerous columns. Quickly verifying high-level assumptions can significantly streamline the analysis process. Let’s explore different types of summaries.\n\n\nCharacter Summary\nBelow, we validate our assumptions:\n\nThere is only one character column, “name”.\nThere are 77 unique rows, aligning with our assumption that each row represents a different cereal.\n\n\n\nShow code\nskimr::yank(skim_output, \"character\")\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nname\n0\n1\n3\n38\n0\n77\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor Summary\nBelow, we confirm our assumptions:\n\nThere are three factor columns: mfr, type, and shelf.\nNo missing values are present.\nShelf is the only ordered factor.\nThe dataset comprises seven manufacturers, two types of cereal (cold and hot), and three shelf heights (1: floor, 2: middle, 3: top).\n\n\n\nShow code\nskimr::yank(skim_output, \"factor\")\n\n\nVariable type: factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nordered\nn_unique\ntop_counts\n\n\n\n\nmfr\n0\n1\nFALSE\n7\nK: 23, G: 22, P: 9, Q: 8\n\n\ntype\n0\n1\nFALSE\n2\nC: 74, H: 3\n\n\nshelf\n0\n1\nTRUE\n3\n3: 36, 2: 21, 1: 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumeric Summary\nLastly, we examine the numeric summary, which provides information similar to the traditional summary. However, it also includes histograms, offering additional insights.\n\n\nShow code\nskimr::yank(skim_output, \"numeric\")\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\ncalories\n0\n1\n106.88\n19.48\n50.00\n100.00\n110.00\n110.00\n160.0\n▁▂▇▂▁\n\n\nprotein\n0\n1\n2.55\n1.09\n1.00\n2.00\n3.00\n3.00\n6.0\n▇▆▂▁▁\n\n\nfat\n0\n1\n1.01\n1.01\n0.00\n0.00\n1.00\n2.00\n5.0\n▇▂▁▁▁\n\n\nsodium\n0\n1\n159.68\n83.83\n0.00\n130.00\n180.00\n210.00\n320.0\n▃▂▇▇▂\n\n\nfiber\n0\n1\n2.15\n2.38\n0.00\n1.00\n2.00\n3.00\n14.0\n▇▃▁▁▁\n\n\ncarbo\n0\n1\n14.60\n4.28\n-1.00\n12.00\n14.00\n17.00\n23.0\n▁▁▆▇▃\n\n\nsugars\n0\n1\n6.92\n4.44\n-1.00\n3.00\n7.00\n11.00\n15.0\n▅▇▇▆▇\n\n\npotass\n0\n1\n96.08\n71.29\n-1.00\n40.00\n90.00\n120.00\n330.0\n▇▇▂▁▁\n\n\nvitamins\n0\n1\n28.25\n22.34\n0.00\n25.00\n25.00\n25.00\n100.0\n▁▇▁▁▁\n\n\nweight\n0\n1\n1.03\n0.15\n0.50\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n1.5\n▁▁▇▁▁\n\n\ncups\n0\n1\n0.82\n0.23\n0.25\n0.67\n0.75\n1.00\n1.5\n▂▇▇▁▁\n\n\nrating\n0\n1\n42.67\n14.05\n18.04\n33.17\n40.40\n50.83\n93.7\n▅▇▅▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall\nExploring this has been enlightening, and I anticipate revisiting it.

While tools like ggplot offer sophisticated visualization options, the initial data review provided by skimr is invaluable."

    "text": "A crosstable of manufacturers cereals with mascots.\n\n\n\nIntroduction\nReady4R is a mailing list offering a free online course initiated by local Oregonian Ted Laderas to impart foundational knowledge in rstats and the tidyverse. Subscribers receive a weekly email delving into various methods for data exploration and analysis. On a weekly basis, I will look into these examples, providing additional insights based on my own experiences.\n\n\nCrosstables\nCrosstables are a helpful way to compare the results of two or more variables in a table, so that we can start asking questions about how they relate. We start this week using the same cereals dataset, but slightly modifying it.\n\n\nShow code\n# Install Package\n# Load Packages\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(janitor)\n# Load Data\ncereals <- readr::read_csv(\"../../../../data/cereal.csv\") |>\n  # clean names by converting to lowercase, replace spaces \n  # with underscore and removes special characters\n  janitor::clean_names() |>\n  # make shelf an ordered factor\n  dplyr::mutate(shelf = factor(shelf, ordered = TRUE)) |>\n  # convert mfr and type columns to categorical data\n  dplyr::mutate(across(c(\"mfr\", \"type\"), as.factor))\n# Rename Labels\nmanu_labels <- c(\"American Home\"=\"A\",\n                   \"General Mills\"=\"G\",\n                   \"Kelloggs\"=\"K\",\n                   \"Nabisco\" = \"N\",\n                   \"Post\" = \"P\",\n                   \"Quaker Oats\" = \"Q\", \n                   \"Ralston Purina\" = \"R\")\ncereals <- cereals |>\n  dplyr::mutate(mfr = forcats::fct_recode(mfr, !!!manu_labels))\n\n\n\n\nCrosstabs with janitor::tabyl()\nFor a single variable we can use janitor::tabyl() to view counts and percentages, as shown below:\n\n\nShow code\ncereals |>\n  janitor::tabyl(shelf) \n\n\n shelf  n   percent\n     1 20 0.2597403\n     2 21 0.2727273\n     3 36 0.4675325\n\n\nA slick way to get counts and percentage per shelf (AKA our ordered factor variable). Next we may want to know whether the manufacturers (factor variable) are evenly distributed in terms of cereal type (factor variable). Note: Use adorn_percentages() and adorn_n() interchangeably to get percentages or counts.\n\n\nShow code\ncereals |>\n  # Create frequency table of manufacturers by type\n  janitor::tabyl(mfr, type) |>\n  # Calculate percentages based on hot and cold cereal totals\n  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = \"row\") |>\n  # Format percentages\n  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting() |>\n  # Add totals\n  janitor::adorn_ns() |>\n  # Nicely format table\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nmfr\nC\nH\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Home\n0.0% (0)\n100.0% (1)\n\n\nGeneral Mills\n100.0% (22)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nKelloggs\n100.0% (23)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nNabisco\n83.3% (5)\n16.7% (1)\n\n\nPost\n100.0% (9)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nQuaker Oats\n87.5% (7)\n12.5% (1)\n\n\nRalston Purina\n100.0% (8)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\underline{\\textbf{Insights}}\\)\n\nOnly 1 manufacturer makes hots cereals: American Home\nOnly 2 manufacturers make both hot and cold cereal: Nabisco and Quaker Oats\nThe remaining 4 manufacturers only make cold cereals: General Mills, Kelloggs, Post, and Raiston Purina\n\n\n\nShelf Height and Marketing\nNow let’s look at the distribution of cereals across different shelf heights (1 = bottom, 2 = middle, and 3 = top). According to an article cited by Ted titled Cereal aisle psychology: All eyes on the consumer, researchers conducted a two-part study confirming that cereals targeting children are typically placed about 23 inches off the ground. They observed that cereals on the top shelves often feature characters staring straight ahead or slightly upward to make eye contact with adults, while those on lower shelves, adorned with cartoon characters with large inviting eyes, create eye contact with children.\nLets use crosstables to visualize how manufacturers distribute their cereals across shelves.\n\n\nShow code\ncereals |>\n  # Create frequency table of manufacturers by shelf\n  janitor::tabyl(mfr, shelf) |>\n  # Calculate percentages based on shelf total\n  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator=\"row\") |>\n  # Format percentages\n  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting() |>\n  # Add totals\n  janitor::adorn_ns() |>\n  # Nicely format table\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nmfr\n1\n2\n3\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Home\n0.0% (0)\n100.0% (1)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nGeneral Mills\n27.3% (6)\n31.8% (7)\n40.9% (9)\n\n\nKelloggs\n17.4% (4)\n30.4% (7)\n52.2% (12)\n\n\nNabisco\n50.0% (3)\n33.3% (2)\n16.7% (1)\n\n\nPost\n22.2% (2)\n11.1% (1)\n66.7% (6)\n\n\nQuaker Oats\n12.5% (1)\n37.5% (3)\n50.0% (4)\n\n\nRalston Purina\n50.0% (4)\n0.0% (0)\n50.0% (4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\underline{\\textbf{Insights}}\\)\n\nAmerican Home exclusively markets its cereals on the second shelf.\nNabisco primarily markets its cereals on the bottom shelf, presumably targeting children.\nGeneral Mills, Kelloggs, Post, and Quaker Oats mainly target adults, as they primarily market their cereals on the top shelf..\nRalston Purina evenly splits its marketing efforts between the top and bottom shelves.\n\n\n\nWhich shelves have cereal mascots?\nNext, let’s investigate which shelves feature cereal mascots, assuming that mascots often indicate cereals marketed towards children. Using data scraped by Ted from the article “268 Cereal Mascots,” we can identify cereals with mascots and their distribution across shelves.\nBelow we clean and join our data sets, and then check the dimmensions are correct.\n\n\nShow code\n# Load Data\nm_c <- utils::read.csv(\"../../../../data/mascots.csv\",\n                       row.names = NULL)\n# Clean cereal names\nm_c <- m_c |>\nmutate(name=stringr::str_replace(name,\"Cap’n Crunch cereals\", \"Cap'n'Crunch\")) |>\n  mutate(name=stringr::str_replace(name, \"Count Chocula cereal\", \"Count Chocula\")) |>\n  mutate(name=stringr::str_replace(name, \"Honey Smacks\", \"Smacks\")) |>\n  mutate(name=stringr::str_replace(name, \"Mini-Wheats\", \"Frosted Mini-Wheats\")) \n# join with cereals data\nmascot_count <- cereals |>\n  left_join(y=m_c, by=\"name\") |>\n  mutate(has_mascot = ifelse(is.na(mascot), \"No\", \"Yes\")) \n# check dimension\ndim(mascot_count)\n\n\n[1] 80 19\n\n\nLet’s do a Quick Check!, and look at the second shelf to see any obvious errors in the data.\n\n\nShow code\nmascot_count |>\n  # Filter to second shelf\n  dplyr::filter(shelf==2) |>\n  # Select only name, manufacturer, mascot, and has_mascot\n  select(name, mfr, mascot, has_mascot) |>\n  # Arrange by mascot \n  arrange(mascot) |>\n  # Nicely format table\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nname\nmfr\nmascot\nhas_mascot\n\n\n\n\nCocoa Puffs\nGeneral Mills\nBuzz the Bee\nYes\n\n\nCap’n’Crunch\nQuaker Oats\nCap’n Crunch (Horatio Magellan Crunch)\nYes\n\n\nCocoa Puffs\nGeneral Mills\nCocoa Puffs’ Sheik of Shake\nYes\n\n\nCorn Pops\nKelloggs\nCornelius (Corny) the Corn\nYes\n\n\nCount Chocula\nGeneral Mills\nCount Chocula\nYes\n\n\nSmacks\nKelloggs\nDig’em Frog\nYes\n\n\nFruity Pebbles\nPost\nFred Flintstone\nYes\n\n\nLucky Charms\nGeneral Mills\nLucky the Leprechaun\nYes\n\n\nFrosted Mini-Wheats\nKelloggs\nMr. Mini-Wheats\nYes\n\n\nCocoa Puffs\nGeneral Mills\nSonny the Cuckoo Bird\nYes\n\n\nRaisin Bran\nKelloggs\nThe Raisin Bran Sun\nYes\n\n\nFroot Loops\nKelloggs\nToucan Sam\nYes\n\n\nTrix\nGeneral Mills\nTrix Rabbit\nYes\n\n\nCinnamon Toast Crunch\nGeneral Mills\nWendell\nYes\n\n\nApple Jacks\nKelloggs\nNA\nNo\n\n\nCream of Wheat (Quick)\nNabisco\nNA\nNo\n\n\nGolden Grahams\nGeneral Mills\nNA\nNo\n\n\nHoney Graham Ohs\nQuaker Oats\nNA\nNo\n\n\nKix\nGeneral Mills\nNA\nNo\n\n\nLife\nQuaker Oats\nNA\nNo\n\n\nMaypo\nAmerican Home\nNA\nNo\n\n\nNut&Honey Crunch\nKelloggs\nNA\nNo\n\n\nStrawberry Fruit Wheats\nNabisco\nNA\nNo\n\n\n\n\n\nTed notes that there are duplicate rows for cereals, because mascots can change over time, or have multiple mascots. This will be problematic for our crosstable which works on counts, so we do a little extra cleaning in the code below.\n\n\nShow code\nmascot_count |>\n  # Select name, shelf, and has_mascot columns\n  select(name, shelf, has_mascot) |>\n  # Remove the duplicate rows\n  distinct() |>\n  # Create crosstable of shelfs by has_mascot\n  janitor::tabyl(shelf, has_mascot) |>\n  # Calculate percentage based on Yes or No to having a mascot\n  janitor::adorn_percentages() |>\n  # Format percentages\n  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting() |>\n  # Add totals\n  janitor::adorn_ns() |>\n  # Nicely format table\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nshelf\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n\n1\n60.0% (12)\n40.0% (8)\n\n\n2\n42.9% (9)\n57.1% (12)\n\n\n3\n100.0% (36)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\underline{\\textbf{Insights}}\\)\n\nCereals with mascots are absent from the top shelf, suggesting that cereal manufacturers predominately target children on the first and second shelves.\n\nFinally, let’s identify which manufacturer boasts the highest number of cereals with mascots:\n\n\nShow code\nmascot_count |>\n  # Select name, manufacturer, and has_mascot\n  select(name, mfr, has_mascot) |>\n  # Remove the duplicate rows\n  distinct() |>\n  # Create crosstable of shelfs by has_mascot\n  janitor::tabyl(mfr, has_mascot) |>\n  # Calculate percentages based on column totals\n  janitor::adorn_percentages(denominator = \"col\") |>\n  # Format percentages\n  janitor::adorn_pct_formatting() |>\n  # Add totals\n  janitor::adorn_ns() |>\n  # Nicely format table\n  knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\nmfr\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n\nAmerican Home\n1.8% (1)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nGeneral Mills\n24.6% (14)\n40.0% (8)\n\n\nKelloggs\n26.3% (15)\n40.0% (8)\n\n\nNabisco\n10.5% (6)\n0.0% (0)\n\n\nPost\n12.3% (7)\n10.0% (2)\n\n\nQuaker Oats\n12.3% (7)\n5.0% (1)\n\n\nRalston Purina\n12.3% (7)\n5.0% (1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\underline{\\textbf{Insights}}\\)\n\nGeneral Mills and Kelloggs lead with the most cereals featuring mascots.\nAmerican Home and Nabisco have no cereals with mascots.\n\n\n\nOverall\nCrosstables serves as a powerful tool for exploring relationships within datasets. Through these analyses, we gain valuable insights into how cereal manufacturers strategically position their products, offering a glimpse into the fascinating world of consumer psychology and marketing dynamics.\n\n\nW.E.B. Dubois’ Visualizations (Black History Month)\nBorn in 1868, Du Bois was not only a scholar and activist but also an innovative thinker in the realm of data representation. As the first Black American to earn a doctorate from Harvard, he embarked on a journey through Europe before returning to the United States to focus on social sciences.\nDriven by a fervent desire to elevate the rights and livelihoods of Black people, Du Bois recognized the power of compelling evidence in effecting societal change. However, he understood that mere statistical data alone could not dismantle generations of racial oppression.\nOne of his seminal works emerged during the 1900 Paris Exposition, where Du Bois seized the opportunity to narrate the story of Black Americans through a novel medium: charts. His collection of 63 data visualizations titled “The Exhibit of American Negroes” was divided into two sections. The first, “A Series of Statistical Charts Illustrating the Condition of the Descendants of Former African Slaves Now in Residence in the United States of America,” offered a broad view of the data at national and international levels. The companion piece, “The Georgia Negro,” focused on a singular state, providing a localized perspective.\nDu Bois meticulously organized his charts into three distinct viewpoints—international, national, and local—thereby weaving a comprehensive narrative encompassing African American history, education, business development, and property ownership. Through interconnected data points, he crafted an elaborate story that evolved seamlessly from the local to the international arena, reinforcing the narrative of Black empowerment and resilience.\n\\(\\underline{\\textbf{Articles}}\\)\n\nHow W.E.B.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn his compelling and thought-provoking book, Carmageddon: How Cars Make Life Worse and What to Do About It, Daniel Knowles invites readers to reconsider the pervasive dominance of automobiles in modern society. Through sharp analysis and persuasive arguments, Knowles explores the multifaceted ways in which car culture adversely affects our daily lives. Below, I share some of the insights and reflections that resonated with me long after turning the last page.\n\n\nCivil Rights and Public Transportation\n\nThe automotive industry’s exponential growth coincided with the era when people of color finally gained the right to sit anywhere on public transportation. This pivotal moment in civil rights history marks a complex intersection with the rise of car culture.\nIn the United States, the expansion of roads and highways was strategically planned in ways that often had deleterious effects on certain communities. These construction projects were intentionally routed to displace specific groups or sever their access to vital city resources, exacerbating social and economic divides.\nDisplacement due to these infrastructure projects frequently forced communities into areas lacking in essential public transportation services. This not only marginalized these groups further but also entrenched car dependency as a primary mode of mobility, despite its broader societal impacts.\nThe Albina Vision Trust in Portland is an exemplary organization actively working to address and rectify transportation policies, among other institutional decisions, that have historically led to the displacement of hundreds of families. Their efforts highlight a crucial movement towards reconciling past injustices with forward-thinking urban and transportation planning.\n\n\n\nCars and Classism\n\nCars since their origination have been a sign of the upper class. Even today you are seen as “less” if you do not own a car.\nA lot of jobs require people to have a drivers license or “valid form of transportation”, which means driving. Even though there are plenty of valid forms of transportation that are not driving.\nOn Class, Capitalism and Urban Planning in Who Framed Roger Rabbit , delves into an intriguing analysis of the film, which is based on the true story of the dismantling of trolley systems across the United States. It offers a compelling look at how the movie intertwines the narratives of class, capitalism, and urban planning, highlighting the profound impact of the automobile industry’s rise on public transit and, by extension, society at large.\nIn Kenneth Grahame’s classic novel, The Wind in the Willows, the character of Mr. Toad epitomizes the reckless and inconsiderate motorist, reflecting critiques of upper-class driving behaviors. For an intriguing dive into the real-world inspiration behind this memorable character, explore the article: Meet the Real-Life Inspiration Behind “Mr.Toad”.\n\n\n\nParking\n\nSociety’s preference for free parking over affordable housing is starkly evident in the increasing number of individuals living out of RVs and cars. This phenomenon highlights a troubling reality: in many areas, it’s more financially feasible to secure a parking spot for a vehicle than to afford living accommodations.\nUrban planning regulations often mandate a disproportionate allocation of parking spaces relative to the square footage of buildings, irrespective of the practical need for such extensive parking. This is particularly illogical for certain types of establishments, such as bars, where the excessive requirement for parking does not align with the nature of the business.\nThe prioritization of free parking spaces over the availability of public bathrooms underscores a misalignment in urban development priorities, where the convenience of car owners is often placed above basic public amenities.\nIdealized representations of car-centric cities frequently omit the extensive infrastructure devoted to parking. These depictions fail to acknowledge the visual, spatial, and environmental impact of parking lots and garages, presenting an unrealistically clean and uncluttered urban landscape.\nThe mandated quantity of parking in urban areas contributes to sprawling city layouts, with destinations spaced too far apart for practical walking. This sprawling effect contradicts one of the fundamental advantages of city living: the ability to navigate the urban environment on foot. By encouraging car dependency, current parking requirements undermine the walkability and, ultimately, the very essence of city life.\n\n\n\nTraffic\n\nTraffic congestion is inherently linked to the prevalence of cars. The solution to reducing traffic lies not in expanding road networks but in decreasing car usage.\nA shift towards public transportation, coupled with investments in its infrastructure, could significantly alleviate traffic congestion. Prioritizing transit development over the construction of more roads offers a sustainable path to reducing urban traffic.\nThe average driver spends a considerable amount of time stuck in traffic, a reality conspicuously absent from car advertisements. These commercials often portray an idealized driving experience, sidestepping the common frustration of traffic jams that many drivers face daily.\n\n\n\nThe Lethal Impact of Some Vehicles\n\nCars are usually designed to keep you safe in crashes. They have special features like engines that drop down and fronts that crumple to absorb crash impacts, protecting the people inside. But, there’s a big problem with large, lifted trucks and vans. Their height means they often skip right over those safety features in smaller cars. Instead of the front crumpling and absorbing the crash, these big vehicles can crash directly into where passengers sit, causing much worse injuries, and fatalities.\nCar manufacturers are aware that these big trucks and vans are more dangerous in accidents. Still, they keep selling them because they’re profitable, not just the vehicles themselves but also all the extra accessories they can sell.\nChoosing one of these big vehicles might feel safer because they’re so sturdy and high off the ground. But the truth is, they turn accidents into much more dangerous situations.\n\n\n\nCharity Car Clubs: A Strategic Image Shift\n\nAware of their controversial impact, car manufacturers have sought to align themselves with the emblematic “American Dream.” To cultivate a positive public image, they’ve initiated charity car clubs. These initiatives gather car owners to engage in charitable activities, all under the auspices of the car company’s brand.\nThis strategy is designed to forge a strong association between car ownership and membership in a commendable community. It intentionally crafts the narrative that owning a car from a particular brand elevates one’s social standing, embedding the vehicle not just as a means of transport but as a symbol of belonging to a virtuous circle.\n\n\n\nVehicles in Developing Nations\n\nThe United States, along with other developed nations, enforces rigorous environmental and safety standards for vehicles. Consequently, cars that no longer comply with these stringent regulations in their home countries are often exported to developing nations.\nThe implementation of import regulations on vehicles by developing countries can inadvertently widen the socioeconomic divide. Such policies may restrict access to affordable transportation for lower-income segments, exacerbating the gap between different social classes.\n\n\n\nCar Corporations and Public Health\n\nThe Volkswagen emissions scandal revealed the company cheated on emissions tests, significantly impacting environmental and public health standards.\nStudies indicate lead from gasoline significantly impaired the IQ of nearly half the U.S. population. The elimination of leaded gasoline has been a critical step in removing a major public health threat, marking a pivotal victory against environmental pollution caused by automotive fuels.\n\n\n\nLimitations of Electric Cars\n\nIn cities where the electrical grid relies on coal for power, the environmental benefits of electric cars are negated. The reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation means that even zero-emission vehicles indirectly contribute to pollution.\nThe production of electric car batteries involves extensive mining operations due to their large size compared to smartphone batteries. This increased demand for raw materials significantly exacerbates the environmental impact associated with their extraction and processing.\nInvestments in infrastructure projects like the Las Vegas Convention Center Loop a one-way, one-lane tunnel that permits only a single car at a time, represents a questionable allocation of resources. This system pales in comparison to traditional subway systems, which offer higher capacity, efficiency, and speed at lower costs.\n\n\n\nGender Bias in Transporation\n\nPublic transportation systems often overlook the needs of women, despite their higher usage rates compared to men.\nMothers, in particular, face challenges when navigating buses or trains with children, highlighting a lack of family-friendly amenities.\nThe design and routing of many public transit options cater predominantly to the conventional nine-to-five work commute, neglecting the complex daily routines of individuals like stay-at-home moms who juggle school drop-offs, grocery shopping, and other errands.\nHistorically, crash test dummies were based on male body types, leading to vehicle safety features that are more optimized for men than for women.\nChild safety in vehicles largely falls to parents, as standard car seat designs cater to adults, not children, necessitating additional child-specific safety equipment.\n\n\n\nWalkable Cities\n\nWalkable cities emphasize pedestrian access, fostering healthier lifestyles by minimizing dependence on cars.\nShifting towards these urban designs offers notable environmental advantages, such as diminished air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions.\nNotable examples include quaint college towns and places like Disney World’s Epcot, designed for easy pedestrian navigation across areas. Unlike the sprawling urban developments of today, these examples showcase the practicality and appeal of compact, walkable communities, underscoring the need for a return to more human-scale urban planning.\n\n\n\nConlusion\nIn “Carmageddon: How Cars Make Life Worse and What to Do About It,” Daniel Knowles navigates the intricate ways in which automobile dominance shapes modern society, spotlighting its profound impact on everything from civil rights and classism to urban planning and public health."

This adjustment is made by adding half of an item’s own percentage to the cumulative sum of percentages of all items below it, shifted upwards by one position (dplyr::lead(csum, 1)), ensuring labels are centered appropriately on or near their respective segments. In cases where this calculation results in NA (specifically for the last item due to the lead function shifting values), pos is set to half of the item’s own percentage, ensuring every item has a defined position for its label.\nThe coord_polar() function customization options include:\n\nSpecifying the \\(\\theta\\) component based on either the x or y aesthetic.\nAdjusting the starting offset from the default 12 o’clock position, expressed in radians.\nSetting the direction parameter to 1 for clockwise orientation or -1 for counterclockwise orientation.\n\nThe plot.title.position() argument aligns the plot’s title centrally over the entire plot area, rather than just centering it above the pie chart, for improved layout balance and title visibility.\nDue to the integrated design of geom_label_repel() within the ggrepel package, altering the color of the connecting lines between the chart and the percentage values would concurrently change the text color of the percentage values. Opting to maintain these lines in black provided a visually appealing contrast, deemed superior to alternative colors such as white. This choice also streamlined the visualization process, circumventing the more time-consuming task of manually positioning percentage labels."
