    "text": "Timeline of Events\nFriday, Jan. 12th\nA winter storm watch for the weekend warned of cold weather and snow. Despite no snowfall, we erred on the side of caution, rescheduling plans for my partner Tanner’s family birthday dinner.\nSaturday Jan. 13th\nThe day started calmly but turned tumultuous as winds picked up in the afternoon, leading to a power outage by 3 PM. Seeking refuge at our local watering hole, we waited for an update from PGE that wouldn’t come for a few days. Enduring the biting cold again, we walked home, and huddled under blankets with our beloved cat, Lulu (as seen in the picture above).\nSunday Jan. 14th\nWith no updates from the power company, our day was spent navigating the cold reality of a powerless home. Concern for Lulu’s well-being prompted makeshift measures to retain heat, including burning old furniture and fortifying our living room against the chill. The fire went out after midnight, but the room still retained heat more than the other rooms in the house.\nMonday Jan. 15th\nAs another storm loomed on the horizon, we made the decision to seek shelter at Tanner’s mom’s house, braving treacherous roads with our faithful companion, Lulu. The drive marked the first communication from the power company for power to return 10PM Tuesday.\nTuesday Jan. 16th\nDespite the icy roads and uncertainty, we received a belated message of restored power at midnight. A modest birthday gift for Tanner amidst the challenges.\nWednesday Jan. 17th\nEager to return home, we cautiously navigated icy roads, only to be greeted by the aftermath of a flooded bathroom upon arrival. Despite intermittent power, we resolved to stay put, improvising with limited resources. PGE says power should be back on tomorrow night at 10PM.\nThursday Jan. 18th\nTanner ventured out in search of firewood checking multiple locations, only to find some at Lowes. Power was out all day, and did not return until 8pm.\nFriday Jan. 19th\nPower was on for most of the day, but went out twice in the later afternoon. Roads are icy, and un-drivable.\nSaturday - Sunday\nPower stayed on, but roads and sidewalks were still icy."

So, if you’re looking how to learn how to work with this data, lessons are already available! Data is available through Figshare.\nCITATION: Woodhouse, Philip; Veldwisch, Gert Jan; Brockington, Daniel; Komakech, Hans C.; Manjichi, Angela; Venot, Jean-Philippe (2018): SAFI Survey Results. doi:10.6084/m9.figshare.6262019.v1\n\nSAFI (Studying African Farmer-Led Irrigation) is a currently running project which is looking at farming and irrigation methods. This is survey data relating to households and agriculture in Tanzania and Mozambique. The survey data was collected through interviews conducted between November 2016 and June 2017 using forms downloaded to Android Smartphones. The survey forms were created using the ODK (Open Data Kit) software via an Excel spreadsheet. The collected data is then sent back to a central server. The server can be used to download the collected data in both JSON and CSV formats. This is a teaching version of the collected data that we will be using. It is not the full dataset.\n\n\nThe survey covered such things as; household features (e.g. construction materials used, number of household members), agricultural practices (e.g. water usage), assets (e.g. number and types of livestock) and details about the household members.\n\n\nThe basic teaching dataset used in these lessons is a subset of the JSON dataset that has been converted into CSV format.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nThis week in the index.R file I tried using the tidytuesdayR package and the variable week <- c(24) in attempt to streamline updating the index file for future weeks.

Will need to do more research on this in future weeks.\nWhen I use the showtext package to assign fonts to the text on my graphs and go to save them as a .png file, if I don’t update the dpi = value (dots per inch) then I have huge spaces in between lines of text. I found that the larger the dpi value the more space there is between lines of text. 150 dpi seems to be a good dpi for this graph.\nI am still debating using the TidyTuesdayR package. It is nice to have the link to the .csv file avaialble in the code."

Then in the visualize package I assigned the fill aesthetic to the “to_highlight” column.\nTo curve the edges of the boxes (so they look more like tombstones) in the styling file I used ggchicklet::geom_chicklet() to assign a curved radius of 3 milimeters.\nTo angle the labels on the x-axis I used ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25)).\nSpacing is a little funky, but I think it might work for this visual.\nFrequentist data visuals seem to be the low hanging fruit for these Tid Tuesday submissions, and my goal is to push onto more predictive and model based visual analysis by the end of the summer."

The new version adds the last several years of data, adds information about time-of-day, and cleans up some errors in the original dataset. We’d love to see visualizations describing the differences between the 2019 dataset and this new dataset!\n\nThe National UFO Reporting Center was founded in 1974 by noted UFO investigator Robert J. Gribble. The Center’s primary function over the past five decades has been to receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events. Throughout its history, the Center has processed over 170,000 reports, and has distributed its information to thousands of individuals.\n\n\n\n\nCode\nThis weeks code retains its core components of cleaning, visualizing, and styling, while the index.R file handles data loading, file execution, and the generation of a data visualization.\n\nCleaningVisualizeStyleindex.RLinks\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\n#### Load Packages ####\n# magrittr: %>% pipe function. \n# dplyr: data cleaning functions.\n# tidyr: data manipulation functions.\nbase::library(dplyr)\nbase::library(magrittr)\nbase::library(tidyr)\n\n#### Cleaning Function ####\nclean <- function(df){\n  # Filter date for Oregon\n  or_df <- df %>%\n    dplyr::filter(state == c(\"OR\")) %>%\n    dplyr::reframe(\n      shape = shape, \n      duration_seconds = duration_seconds,\n      duration_minutes = duration_seconds/60)\n  # remove nas \n  or_df$duration_seconds <- stats::na.omit(or_df$duration_seconds)\n  # Subset for all data 5 minutes or less\n  clean_df <- \n    base::subset(or_df, \n                 duration_seconds < 301) %>%\n    tidyr::replace_na(list(shape = c(\"not available\")))\n    \n  return(clean_df)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\n#### Load Packages ####\nbase::library(ggplot2)\n\n#### Visual Function ####\nvis <- function(clean_df){\n  vis <- ggplot2::ggplot(\n    clean_df,\n    ggplot2::aes(x = shape,\n                 y = duration_minutes,\n                 fill = shape,\n                 color = shape)) +\n    ggplot2::geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA) +\n    ggplot2::geom_jitter(\n      na.rm = TRUE, \n      color = \"#d2ff46\", \n      alpha = 0.7)\n  return(vis)\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShow Code\n#### Load Packages ####\n# ggplot2: graphing functions.\n# showtext: font functions. \nbase::library(\"ggplot2\")\nbase::library(\"showtext\")\n\n#### Load Fonts ####\nsysfonts::font_add_google(\"Orbitron\", \"font\")\nshowtext::showtext_auto()\n\n#### Load Colors ####\ncol1 <- \"#d2ff46\"\ncol2 <- \"#0d0d0d\"\ncol3 <- \"white\"\n\n#### Axis Labels ####\naxis_labs <- c(\"changing\", \"orb\", \"formation\", \"oval\", \"unknown\",\n               \"cigar\", \"rectangle\", \"circle\", \"egg\", \"sphere\", \n               \"other\", \"light\", \"triangle\", \"teardrop\", \"cross\",\n               \"diamond\", \"cylinder\", \"disk\", \"fireball\", \"not available\", \n               \"flash\", \"chevron\", \"cone\")\n\n#### Style Function ####\nsty <- function(vis){\n  sty <- vis +\n    # labs\n    ggplot2::labs(\n      title = \"Shapes in Oregon: Short Sightings\",\n      subtitle = \"\\nThe following box plot displays the distribution of UFO sightings lasting less than 5 minutes in Oregon, categorized by \\ntheir reported shape.

Since the data points represent estimates of sighting durations, and they are mostly in minutes rather than specific seconds, using geom_point() would result in straight lines of dots across the box plots. Therefore, I decided to apply jittering using geom_jitter() to add some randomness to the point positions, which I deemed acceptable for visualizing the estimated sighting durations.\nIn the styling function, I utilized ggplot2::scale_x_discrete(limits = axis_labs) to define the order of the x-axis labels. Note that if you misspell a word, the data will not appear on your graph.\nAs the styling function grows longer, I find myself considering the idea of splitting it up. One approach I might explore is separating the labels into their own distinct function. This way, I can assess whether this change significantly improves the readability of the styling function.\nThis visual raises some concerns, and I acknowledge the need to allocate more time for statistical analysis in the future. The following issues can be identified with this visual.\n\n\nLack of statistical significance in the arrangement of UFO shapes along the x-axis: The order was chosen based on aesthetic and readability considerations, rather than any statistical criteria.\nAbsence of statistical analysis for outlier elimination: Since the data was limited to sightings lasting 5 minutes or less, no statistical analysis was conducted to identify and eliminate outliers."

This visual style would make it easier for the reader to notice that both “Access to Guns” and “Other Gun Safety Laws” have 14 new laws in 2022. Similarly the “Domestic Violence” and “Gun Dealer Regulations” both have 6 new gun laws in 2022."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn the landscape of personal development and interpersonal skills, few books have stood the test of time as prominently as Dale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People.” Despite its age, the core principles Carnegie presents remain remarkably relevant, addressing the timeless human desire for connection and understanding. However, it’s not without its controversies; some readers may find its techniques manipulative, and some of Carnegie’s idols (such as Robert E. Lee and John D. Rockefeller) and sexitst pro-capitalist ideals problematic.\nIn the following, I share my notes - a compilation of quotes and insights that I found particularly striking. These reflections are intended to capture the essence of Carnegie’s advice through my lens, underscoring its potential wisdom.\n\n\nPart One: Fundamental Techniques in Handling People\nThis section covers the basic principles of interacting with others, emphasizing the importance of avoiding criticism, condemnation, or complaints.\n\nBy criticizing, we do not make lasting changes and often incur resentment.\nDon’t criticize them, they are doing just as you would under similar circumstances.\nAny fool can criticize, complain, and condemn—and most fools do. But it takes character and self-control to be understanding and forgiving.\nTell me what makes you feel important and I’ll tell you the type of person you are.\n\n\n\nI learned thirty years ago that it is foolish to scold. I have enough trouble overcoming my own limitations without fretting over the fact that God has not seen fit to distribute evenly the gift of intelligence.\n\nJohn Wanamaker\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge not, that ye be not judeged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother’s eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\n\nMatthew 7:1-3\n\n\n\n\n\nI will speak ill of no one. I will speak all the good I know of everybody.\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand all is to forgive all.\n\nEvelyn Waugh\n\n\n\n\n\nI shall not pass this way again, so when I do it let me be kind.\n\nEtienne de Grellet\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Two: Six Ways to Make People Like You\nHere, Carnegie presents simple strategies to become more likable and build stronger, more positive relationships with others.\n\nBecome genuinely interested in other people.\n\nYou can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people that in 2 years by trying to get other people interested in you.\nIt is the individual who is not interested in their fellow man that has the greatest difficulties in life and provides the greatest injury to others. It’s from those individuals that all human failures spring.\nIf the author doesn’t like people, than people won’t like their stories.\nWe all like people who admire us.\n“I love my audience.”\n\n\n\nEvery man I meet is my superior in some way, and in that I learn from him.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson\n\n\n\nSmile.\n\nEncouragement is more effective teaching device than punishment.\nStop talking about what you want, and see things from other peoples sides.\nAct and speak as if cheerfulness is already there.\nHappiness depends on inside conditions. It is what you think about it.\nTo think rightly is to create.\n\n\n\nThere is nothing good or bad, but thinking makes it so.\n\nShakespeare\n\n\n\n\n\nWe become like that on which our hearts are fixed. Carry your chin in and the crown of your head high. We are gods in the chrysalis.\n\nJeffrey J. Denning\n\n\n\nRemember that people like hearing their name.\nBe a good listener. Encourage others to talk about themselves.\nTalk in terms of the other person’s interests.\nMake the other person feel important and do it sincerely.\n\nOil the cogs with little things such as please, thank you, if you don’t mind, and so on.\nRecognize other people’s importance and recognize it sincerely.\nTalk to people about themselves and they will listen for hours.\n\n\n\nThe deepest urge in human nature is the desire to be important.\n\nJohn Dewey\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deepest principle in human nature is the craving to be appreciated.\n\nWilliam James\n\n\n\n\n\nDo unto others how you would have others do unto you.\n\nMathew 7:12\n\n\n\n\n\nBut man, proud man, Drest in a little brief authority, Most ignorant of what he’s most assur’d; His glassy essence, like an angry ape, Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven, As make the angels weep.\n\nShakespeare\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart Three: How to Win People to Your Way of Thinking\nThis part offers tactics for persuading others to your point of view without causing offense or arousing resentment.\n\nThe best way to win an argument is to avoid it.\n\nYou can’t win an argument.\nDistrust your first impression.\nWelcome the disagreement.\nWhen two partners always agree then one of them is not necessary.\nPerhaps there is something you haven’t thought about. Be thankful it’s been brought to your attention.\nWatch out for your first reaction. It may be you at your worst, not your best.\nYou can measure the size of a person by what makes them angry.\nBuild bridges of understanding, not barriers of misunderstanding.\nDwell on areas where you agree with others.\nPromise to think over their ideas and mean it. It’s easier to agree to think about their points.\nThank your opponents sincerely for their interests. Anyone who takes the time to disagree with you is interested in the same things you are.\nThink of your opponents as people who want to help you. Think of your opponents as your friends.\nWhen one person is yelling the other should be listening because when two people yell then no one is listening.\n\nQuestions to Ask Yourself\n\nCould my opponents be right or partially right?\nIs there truth or merit in their position or argument?\nIs my reaction one that will relieve the problem, or just relieve my frustration?\nWill my reaction draw my opponents further away or closer to me?\nWill my reaction demonstrate the estimation of good will people have of me?\nWill I win or lose? What price will I have to pay if I win?\nIf I am quiet about it will the disagreement blow over?\nIs this difficult situation an opportunity for me?\n\n\n\nIf you argue you will never have a person’s good will.\n\nBenjamin Franklin\n\n\n\n\n\nHere lies the body of William Jay, Who died maintaining his right of way— He was right, dead right, as he sped along, But he’s just as dead as if he were wrong.\n\nCarnege\n\n\n\n\n\nHatred is never ended by hatered, but by love.\n\nBuddah\n\n\n\n\n\nYield larger things to which you can show no more than equal right; and yield lesser ones, though clearly your own. Better give your path to a dog than be bitten by him in contesting for the right. Even killing the dog would not cure the bite.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\n\n\nShow respect for the other person’s opinions. Never say “You’re wrong”.\n\nIf you are going to prove anything, don’t make anybody know it.\nBe wise than other people if you can; but do not tell them so.\nWhen you argue you are not persuading.\nRidicule and abuse never make someone agree with you.\nBenjamin Franklin never spoke in certainties.\nReply to your opposition stating that in some cases you could see their perspective being right. You could also see some cases in which that is not the case.\nConversations will go more pleasantly and a modest suggestion will be better received.\nYou will have less mortification when found to be in the wrong, and more people to agree with you when you are right.\nMake it a point not to disagree or tell the other person they are wrong.\nBeing diplomatic will help you gain your point.\n\n\n\nMen must be taught as if you taught them not, and thing proposed as things forgot.\n\nAlexander Pope\n\n\n\n\n\nYou cannot teach a man anything, only help him find it within himself.\n\nGalileo\n\n\n\n\n\nWe sometimes find ourselves changing our minds without any resistance or heavy emotion, but if we are told that we are wrong we resent the imputation and harden our hearts. We are incredibly heedless in the formation of our beliefs, but find ourselves filled with an illicit passion for them when anyone proposes to rob us of their companionship. It is obviously not the ideas themselves that are dear to us, but our self-esteem which is threatened.\n\nJames harvey Robinson, The Mind in the Making\n\n\n\n\n\nBen you are impossible. Your opinions have a slap in them for everyone who differs with you. They have become so offensive that nobody cares for them. Your friends find that they enjoy themselves better when you are not around. You know so much that no one can tell you anything. Indeed no one is going to try for the act and effort would only lead to discomfort and hard work. Therefore you are likely never to know anymore than you do now, which is very little.\n\nQuote from Benjamin Franklins Autobiography\n\n\n\n\n\nI judge people by their principles not by my own.\n\nMLK\n\n\n\n\n\nAgree with thyn adversary quickly.\n\nJesus\n\n\n\nIf you are wrong admit it quickly and emphatically.\n\nWhen you say the other person’s criticism of yourself first, then the criticism is coming from your mouth, and the blow will be much softer.\nAny fool can defend their mistakes, but it takes a large person to discuss failure.\nBy fighting you never get enough, but by yielding you get more than you expected.\n\nBegin in a friendly way.\n\nGentleness and friendliness are stronger than brute force.\n\n\n\nIf you come at me with your fists doubled, I think I can promise you that mine will double as fast as yours; but if you come to me and say, ‘Let us sit down and take counsel together, and, if we differ from each other, understand why it is that we differ, just what the points at issue are,’ we will presently find that we are not so far apart after all, that the points on which we differ are few and the points on which we agree are many, and that if we only have the patience and the candor and the desire to get together, we will get together.\n\nWoodrow Wilson\n\n\n\n\n\nA drop of honey catches more flies than a gallon of gall.\n\nAbraham Lincoln\n\n\n\nGet the other person saying “yes yes” immediately.\n\nBegin and keep on emphasizing the things on which you agree. You are both striving for the same end, but your only difference is of method not of purpose.\nA no response is a most difficult handicap to overcome. When you have said no, all your pride and personality demands that you remain consistent with yourself.\nIt takes more force to go in the opposite direction.\nWhen someone says no they are doing more than that. The body is doing more than that. When a person says yes, no physical or mental withdraw happens.\nA skillful speaker gets a yes response.\nThe more yeses we can receive, the more likely we are to succeed at capturing our proposal.\nThe Socratic method is based on getting a yes response.\nAsk gentle questions to get a yes response.\nHe who treads softly goes far.\n\nLet the other person do a great deal of the talking.\n\nLet the other person talk themselves out.\n\nLet the other person feel the idea is theirs.\nTry honestly to see things from the other person’s point of view.\n\nSuccess when dealing with people depends on a sympathetic grasp of the other person’s viewpoint.\nCooperativeness in conversation is achieved when you show that you consider the other person’s ideas and feelings as important as your own.\nThink always in terms of the other person’s point of view.\n\nBe sympathetic to the other person’s ideas and desires.\n\nI don’t blame you for feeling how you do, and if I were you I would feel as you do.\n\n\nThere but for the grace of god go I.\nProverb\n\nAppeal to the nobler motives.\n\nBasically there is a real reason why someone does something, and then the reason they tell people (the nobler reason). Appeal to these reasons.\nStory about a guy who didn’t want a specific picture of him in the paper, but wrote a letter saying that it was his mother who did not like this picture. Appealing to the nobler motive of respecting a mothers wishes.\n\nDramatize your ideas.\n\nShow your point, don’t just explain it.\n\nThrow down a challenge.\n\nMotivate with friendly competition.\n\n\n\n\nPart Four: Be a Leader: How to Change People Without Giving Offense or Arrousing Resentment\nThe final section focuses on leadership and how to encourage others to change their behavior or beliefs in a positive way.\n\nBeing a leader often involves changing people’s behaviors and attitudes.\n\n\nBegin with praise and honest appreciation.\nCall attention to people’s mistakes indirectly.\nTalk about your own mistakes before criticizing others.\nAsk questions instead of giving direct orders.\nLet the other person save face.\nPraise the slightest improvement, and praise every improvement. Be hearty in your approbation and lavish in your praise.\nGive the other person a fine reputation to live up to.\n\n\nAssume a virtue if you have it not.\n\nShakespeare\n\n\n\nUse encouragement. Make the fault seem easy to correct.\nMake the other person happy about doing the thing that you suggest.\n“Playbook”\n\nBe sincere, and do not promise anything.\nKnow what you want the other person to do.\nBe empathetic, and ask what the other person wants.\nWhat are the benefits the other person will get doing what you want?\nMatch those benefits to the things that they want.\nWhen you make your request, put it in a form that they personally will benefit from doing this.\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nDale Carnegie’s “How to Win Friends and Influence People” provides a foundational perspective on the art of interaction and persuasion. While its age-old advice resonates with timeless truths about human nature, the modern reader must navigate its principles with a critical eye."

I am using a slightly modified version compared to Ted’s, necessitating adjustments to the code below.\n\n\nShow code\n# Load Data\ncereals <- readr::read_csv(\"../../../../data/cereal.csv\") |>\n  # clean names by converting to lowercase, replace spaces \n  # with underscore and removes special characters\n  janitor::clean_names() |>\n  # make shelf an ordered factor\n  dplyr::mutate(shelf = factor(shelf, ordered = TRUE)) |>\n  # convert mfr and type columns to categorical data\n  dplyr::mutate(across(c(\"mfr\", \"type\"), as.factor))\n\n\n\nOverall Summary\nBefore getting into the skimr package, let’s start with a traditional summary of the dataset:\n\n\nShow code\nsummary(cereals)\n\n\n     name           mfr    type      calories        protein     \n Length:77          A: 1   C:74   Min.   : 50.0   Min.   :1.000  \n Class :character   G:22   H: 3   1st Qu.:100.0   1st Qu.:2.000  \n Mode  :character   K:23          Median :110.0   Median :3.000  \n                    N: 6          Mean   :106.9   Mean   :2.545  \n                    P: 9          3rd Qu.:110.0   3rd Qu.:3.000  \n                    Q: 8          Max.   :160.0   Max.   :6.000  \n                    R: 8                                         \n      fat            sodium          fiber            carbo     \n Min.   :0.000   Min.   :  0.0   Min.   : 0.000   Min.   :-1.0  \n 1st Qu.:0.000   1st Qu.:130.0   1st Qu.: 1.000   1st Qu.:12.0  \n Median :1.000   Median :180.0   Median : 2.000   Median :14.0  \n Mean   :1.013   Mean   :159.7   Mean   : 2.152   Mean   :14.6  \n 3rd Qu.:2.000   3rd Qu.:210.0   3rd Qu.: 3.000   3rd Qu.:17.0  \n Max.   :5.000   Max.   :320.0   Max.   :14.000   Max.   :23.0  \n                                                                \n     sugars           potass          vitamins      shelf      weight    \n Min.   :-1.000   Min.   : -1.00   Min.   :  0.00   1:20   Min.   :0.50  \n 1st Qu.: 3.000   1st Qu.: 40.00   1st Qu.: 25.00   2:21   1st Qu.:1.00  \n Median : 7.000   Median : 90.00   Median : 25.00   3:36   Median :1.00  \n Mean   : 6.922   Mean   : 96.08   Mean   : 28.25          Mean   :1.03  \n 3rd Qu.:11.000   3rd Qu.:120.00   3rd Qu.: 25.00          3rd Qu.:1.00  \n Max.   :15.000   Max.   :330.00   Max.   :100.00          Max.   :1.50  \n                                                                         \n      cups           rating     \n Min.   :0.250   Min.   :18.04  \n 1st Qu.:0.670   1st Qu.:33.17  \n Median :0.750   Median :40.40  \n Mean   :0.821   Mean   :42.67  \n 3rd Qu.:1.000   3rd Qu.:50.83  \n Max.   :1.500   Max.   :93.70  \n                                \n\n\nThe above summary provides a wealth of information. For columns designated as factors (mfr, type, and shelf), we observe counts for each category. Other column types display quantiles.\nNow, let’s utilize skimr::skim to generate a condensed summary of the dataset:\n\n\nShow code\nskim_output <- skimr::skim(cereals)\nsummary(skim_output)\n\n\n\nData summary\n\n\nName\ncereals\n\n\nNumber of rows\n77\n\n\nNumber of columns\n16\n\n\n_______________________\n\n\n\nColumn type frequency:\n\n\n\ncharacter\n1\n\n\nfactor\n3\n\n\nnumeric\n12\n\n\n________________________\n\n\n\nGroup variables\nNone\n\n\n\n\n\nThis condensed summary, as Ted aptly notes, offers a more succinct overview. Discrepancies in variable counts by type often signal the need for variable transformation. Personally, I find this approach invaluable, especially when dealing with datasets containing numerous columns. Quickly verifying high-level assumptions can significantly streamline the analysis process. Let’s explore different types of summaries.\n\n\nCharacter Summary\nBelow, we validate our assumptions:\n\nThere is only one character column, “name”.\nThere are 77 unique rows, aligning with our assumption that each row represents a different cereal.\n\n\n\nShow code\nskimr::yank(skim_output, \"character\")\n\n\nVariable type: character\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmin\nmax\nempty\nn_unique\nwhitespace\n\n\n\n\nname\n0\n1\n3\n38\n0\n77\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFactor Summary\nBelow, we confirm our assumptions:\n\nThere are three factor columns: mfr, type, and shelf.\nNo missing values are present.\nShelf is the only ordered factor.\nThe dataset comprises seven manufacturers, two types of cereal (cold and hot), and three shelf heights (1: floor, 2: middle, 3: top).\n\n\n\nShow code\nskimr::yank(skim_output, \"factor\")\n\n\nVariable type: factor\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nordered\nn_unique\ntop_counts\n\n\n\n\nmfr\n0\n1\nFALSE\n7\nK: 23, G: 22, P: 9, Q: 8\n\n\ntype\n0\n1\nFALSE\n2\nC: 74, H: 3\n\n\nshelf\n0\n1\nTRUE\n3\n3: 36, 2: 21, 1: 20\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumeric Summary\nLastly, we examine the numeric summary, which provides information similar to the traditional summary. However, it also includes histograms, offering additional insights.\n\n\nShow code\nskimr::yank(skim_output, \"numeric\")\n\n\nVariable type: numeric\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nskim_variable\nn_missing\ncomplete_rate\nmean\nsd\np0\np25\np50\np75\np100\nhist\n\n\n\n\ncalories\n0\n1\n106.88\n19.48\n50.00\n100.00\n110.00\n110.00\n160.0\n▁▂▇▂▁\n\n\nprotein\n0\n1\n2.55\n1.09\n1.00\n2.00\n3.00\n3.00\n6.0\n▇▆▂▁▁\n\n\nfat\n0\n1\n1.01\n1.01\n0.00\n0.00\n1.00\n2.00\n5.0\n▇▂▁▁▁\n\n\nsodium\n0\n1\n159.68\n83.83\n0.00\n130.00\n180.00\n210.00\n320.0\n▃▂▇▇▂\n\n\nfiber\n0\n1\n2.15\n2.38\n0.00\n1.00\n2.00\n3.00\n14.0\n▇▃▁▁▁\n\n\ncarbo\n0\n1\n14.60\n4.28\n-1.00\n12.00\n14.00\n17.00\n23.0\n▁▁▆▇▃\n\n\nsugars\n0\n1\n6.92\n4.44\n-1.00\n3.00\n7.00\n11.00\n15.0\n▅▇▇▆▇\n\n\npotass\n0\n1\n96.08\n71.29\n-1.00\n40.00\n90.00\n120.00\n330.0\n▇▇▂▁▁\n\n\nvitamins\n0\n1\n28.25\n22.34\n0.00\n25.00\n25.00\n25.00\n100.0\n▁▇▁▁▁\n\n\nweight\n0\n1\n1.03\n0.15\n0.50\n1.00\n1.00\n1.00\n1.5\n▁▁▇▁▁\n\n\ncups\n0\n1\n0.82\n0.23\n0.25\n0.67\n0.75\n1.00\n1.5\n▂▇▇▁▁\n\n\nrating\n0\n1\n42.67\n14.05\n18.04\n33.17\n40.40\n50.83\n93.7\n▅▇▅▁▁\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall\nExploring this has been enlightening, and I anticipate revisiting it. It’s surprising how frequently I find myself explaining to non-data professionals that the mean (or average) isn’t always the most reliable indicator of sample behavior. Data can be heavily skewed, making visualizations essential for accurate interpretation. While tools like ggplot offer sophisticated visualization options, the initial data review provided by skimr is invaluable."
