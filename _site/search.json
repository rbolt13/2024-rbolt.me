Despite no snowfall, we erred on the side of caution, rescheduling plans for my partner Tannerâ€™s family birthday dinner.\nSaturday Jan.Â 13th\nThe day started calmly but turned tumultuous as winds picked up in the afternoon, leading to a power outage by 3 PM. Seeking refuge at our local watering hole, we waited for an update from PGE that wouldnâ€™t come for a few days. Enduring the biting cold again, we walked home, and huddled under blankets with our beloved cat, Lulu (as seen in the picture above).\nSunday Jan.Â 14th\nWith no updates from the power company, our day was spent navigating the cold reality of a powerless home. Concern for Luluâ€™s well-being prompted makeshift measures to retain heat, including burning old furniture and fortifying our living room against the chill. The fire went out after midnight, but the room still retained heat more than the other rooms in the house.\nMonday Jan.Â 15th\nAs another storm loomed on the horizon, we made the decision to seek shelter at Tannerâ€™s momâ€™s house, braving treacherous roads with our faithful companion, Lulu. The drive marked the first communication from the power company for power to return 10PM Tuesday.\nTuesday Jan.Â 16th\nDespite the icy roads and uncertainty, we received a belated message of restored power at midnight. A modest birthday gift for Tanner amidst the challenges.\nWednesday Jan.Â 17th\nEager to return home, we cautiously navigated icy roads, only to be greeted by the aftermath of a flooded bathroom upon arrival. Despite intermittent power, we resolved to stay put, improvising with limited resources. PGE says power should be back on tomorrow night at 10PM.\nThursday Jan.Â 18th\nTanner ventured out in search of firewood checking multiple locations, only to find some at Lowes. Power was out all day, and did not return until 8pm.\nFriday Jan.Â 19th\nPower was on for most of the day, but went out twice in the later afternoon. Roads are icy, and un-drivable.\nSaturday - Sunday\nPower stayed on, but roads and sidewalks were still icy."
